# Dashboards and Low-Code Apps

This section of the documentation provides you with an overview of two DataMiner modules: the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) and [Low-Code Apps](xref:Application_framework).

Both the Dashboards app and Low-Code Apps module are platform-independent web interfaces that allow you to consolidate any data from the monitored system. Dashboards and applications can be as simple or complex as you want, using components that are configured in the same way across both modules. These modules are particularly useful for selectively sharing specific data with third parties, without the need to grant access to your entire system.

However, Low-Code Apps deviate from the Dashboards app in that they also offer the functionality to trigger actions based on events, display panels as pop-up window or overlays on pages, and incorporate menus and submenus into the header bar.

Both Dashboards and Low-Code Apps leverage the same [set of visualizations](xref:Available_visualizations), enabling you to create custom dashboards and applications that seamlessly interact with data from your DataMiner System.
