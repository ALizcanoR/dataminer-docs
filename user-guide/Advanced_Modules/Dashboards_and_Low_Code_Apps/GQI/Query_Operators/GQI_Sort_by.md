# Sort by

Available from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35807 & 35834 -->. The *Sort by* query operator sorts the data based on a specific column. When you select this operator, you will need to select the column to sort by. By default, sorting happens in descending order. To sort in ascending order instead, select the *Ascending* checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to sort by another column after you have used this operator, use the [Then sort by](#then-sort-by) operator. If you use *Sort by* again, this will nullify the result of the previous sorting operation.
