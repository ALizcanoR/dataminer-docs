# Then sort by

Available from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35807 & 35834 -->. The *Then sort by* query operator sorts the data based on a specific column, after it has already been sorted based on another column.  When you select this operator, you will need to select the column to sort by. By default, sorting happens in descending order. To sort in ascending order instead, select the *Ascending* checkbox.
