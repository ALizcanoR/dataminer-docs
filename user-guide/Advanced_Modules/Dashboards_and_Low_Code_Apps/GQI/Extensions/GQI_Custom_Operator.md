The custom operator is available in soft launch from DataMiner 10.2.7 onwards, if the soft-launch option *GenericInterface* is enabled.

To learn more about the predefined interfaces that a custom operator implements to add the desired functionality, see [Building blocks](xref:CO_Building_blocks). We also provide a complete overview of the [life cycle of a custom operator](xref:CO_Life_cycle).
