# Building blocks of an ad hoc data source

An ad hoc data source implements predefined interfaces that can be considered building blocks as they add the desired functionality to the data source.

The [*IGQIDataSource* interface](xref:IGQIDataSource) is the only required interface. It must be implemented for the class to be detected by GQI as a data source.

All other interfaces add additional functionality. See also: [Interfaces in the ad hoc data script] (xref:Configuring_an_ad_hoc_data_source_in_a_query#interfaces-in-the-ad-hoc-data-script)
