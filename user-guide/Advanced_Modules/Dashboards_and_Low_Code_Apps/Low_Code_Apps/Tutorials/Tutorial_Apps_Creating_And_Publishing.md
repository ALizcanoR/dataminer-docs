- [Step 2: Publish the app](#step-2-publish-the-app)

## Step 1: Create an app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. Create a new app by clicking the '+' icon, which appears when hovering over a section. A preliminary version of a new application is generated, known as a draft. Drafts serve as temporary iterations that aid in the development of an app. Once the necessary adjustments and modifications are made, these drafts can be released for public use.
