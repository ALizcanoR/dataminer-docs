# Edit an existing app

This tutorial lesson demonstrates how you edit an existing app.

## Overview

- [Step 1: Edit the latest version of your app](#step-1-edit-the-latest-version-of-your-app)
- [Step 2: Edit a previous version of your app](#step-2-edit-a-previous-version-of-your-app)

## Step 1: Edit the latest version of your app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. To start editing, simply click on your user image or initials and select the option 'Edit'.

1. The application editor is reopened, which was used before when making the application initially. A new draft is made where you can make the necessary changes to your app. When you're ready, you can publish the application again to make the latest version available to everyone.

## Step 2: Edit a previous version of your app

Occasionally, there may be a need to edit a previous version of the application. This could be to review the previous configuration of the app or to roll back to the previously published version.

1. To start from a certain version, you can click on your user image or initials and select 'Versions'.

1. This brings up a list of previous versions. Each previous version can be edited by clicking on the pencil.

1. Just like editing the most recent published version, selecting this option will open up the application editor. However, this time, the chosen version serves as the foundation for the new draft.
