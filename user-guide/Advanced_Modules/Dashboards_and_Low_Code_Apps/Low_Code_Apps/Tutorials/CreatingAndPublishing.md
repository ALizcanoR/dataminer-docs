## Step 1: Create an app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. Create a new app by clicking the '+' icon, which appears when hovering over a section. A preliminary version of a new application is generated, known as a draft. Drafts serve as temporary iterations that aid in the development of an app. Once the necessary adjustments and modifications are made, these drafts can be released for public use.

## Step 2: Publish the app

Our app is currently in the 'Draft' stage, but let's take it live by publishing it and making it visible to everyone.

1. To publish the app, simply click on the first icon located at the top right corner.
