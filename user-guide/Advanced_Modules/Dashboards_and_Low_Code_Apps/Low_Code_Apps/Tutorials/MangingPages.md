# Managing pages in your app

This tutorial will show you how to add, change, and remove pages in your app.

> [!NOTE]
> You will see a navigation rail in your app only if you have two or more pages. If your app has only one page, there won't be a navigation rail displayed.

## Overview

- [Step 2: Configure how pages are shown](#step-2-configure-how-pages-are-shown)
- [Step 3: Duplicating and deleting a page](#step-3-duplicating-and-deleting-a-page)

## Step 1: Adding pages to your app

1. To add pages to your app, go to the left sidebar. Look for the bottom item that says "Create page" and click on it to create a new page.

## Step 2: Configure how pages are shown

1. To rename pages, you have two options. You can select the existing text of the page in the navigation rail and set a new name, or you can choose the page and modify its name at the top of the gray detail sidebar.

2. In the gray sidebar, you will find an "Icon" section as well. In this section, you can search for and select an icon to represent your page. The chosen icon will be displayed in the navigation rail at all times, even when it is collapsed.

3. To remove pages from the navigation rail, click on the three dots, which will open a context menu. From there, select "Hide from sidebar" to ensure that the page is not included in the sidebar.

4. You can rearrange the order of pages in your app, including the initial page, by simply reordering them. The initial page is the one located at the top of the navigation rail. To reorder your pages, hover over a page and use the arrows that appear to move it up or down.

## Step 3: Duplicating and deleting a page

You can quickly create a duplicate of an existing page, resulting in a new page that is identical to the original. All configurations, including feed references, will be preserved in this duplicated page.

> [!NOTE]
> While the feed references are maintained, it's important to note that other pages that consume feeds from the duplicated page will only receive values from the originally duplicated page.

1. To duplicate a page, open the context menu by clicking on the three dots. From there, select "Duplicate" to create a copy of the page. You can then customize the duplicated page to suit your requirements.

2. Likewise, you can also remove pages from your app by deleting them.
