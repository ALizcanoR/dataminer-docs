# Using the EPM filter section

You can drill down to specific information by means of the filter section:

- Depending on the protocol, there can be several filter boxes for each chain.

- To navigate to a particular object, select items in the filter boxes, starting with the top box, until you reach the item in question.

- When you clear a filter, if there is any previous filter, it is reapplied. To clear this “history”, click *Clear all*.

- When available, after you have selected an item, additional clickable fields may appear next to the filter box, such as *KPIs* or *CPEs*. When you click such a field, a new window will be opened with detailed information.

- In a KPI window, the right-click menu allows you to copy values from the KPI list.
