# APIs and tokens in DataMiner Cube

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously using the *APIDeployment* soft-launch option, keep in mind that the *User-Defined APIs* tab will replace the obsolete *API deployment* tab in the future. Make sure to move your old APIs from API deployment to the new feature. For information on how to create APIs from existing scripts, see [using an existing script page](xref:UD_APIs_Using_existing_scripts).

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is in preview and is not fully released yet. For now, it should only be used on a staging platform. It should not be used in a production environment.

## Manage APIs and tokens

From DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.6 onwards, you can manage the APIs and tokens of your system in DataMiner Cube.

To do so, go to *System Center* > *User-Defined APIs*. There, you can create, edit or delete your APIs and tokens.

> For more information, you can go to the [Creating an API and token(s) in Automation](xref:UD_APIs_Define_New_API#creating-an-api-and-tokens-in-automation).

## Enable or disable API tokens

It is possible to either enable or disable an API token when right-clcking it in the token table.
