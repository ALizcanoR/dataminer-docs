# DMS Router Control

DMS Router Control is a DataMiner module that allows you to intuitively configure all matrices in your DataMiner System in a single, customizable user interface.

When you open the module for the first time, you will find a default user interface (called a configuration) that contains a tab page for every matrix found in your DMS. Next to that default configuration, you can create additional configurations. All configurations (including the default) can be customized.
