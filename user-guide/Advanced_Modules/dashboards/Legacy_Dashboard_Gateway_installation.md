# Legacy Dashboard Gateway installation

It is possible to give users access to the legacy DataMiner Dashboards even if they do not have access to DataMiner, by means of a DMS Dashboard Gateway.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Installing a DMS Dashboard Gateway](xref:Installing_a_DMS_Dashboard_Gateway)

- [Adding a Dashboards User to the DMS](xref:Adding_a_Dashboards_User_to_the_DMS)

- [Configuring dashboard access rights](xref:Configuring_dashboard_access_rights)

- [Dashboard Gateway troubleshooting](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_troubleshooting)

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy Dashboard Gateway only supports the legacy Dashboards app, not the new app available from DataMiner 9.6.9 onwards. For a Dashboard Gateway supporting the new app, see [Dashboard Gateway installation](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_installation).
