# Data Aggregator

Data Aggregator is a DxM ([DataMiner Extension Module](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules)) that can be used to schedule GQI queries to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It can connect to multiple DataMiner Systems and combine the results of the GQI queries executed per DMS into one result. This result can then be exported to a CSV file or made available over a WebSocket connection.
