# Using the DOM Editor

When you install the DOM Designer package, the DOM Editor Automation script is Automatically included in the `DOM\DOM Main scripts` Automation folder.

You can run the script from the Automation module in DataMiner Cube in order to add a field, change a field name, delete a field, add a button, or name a DOM instance.
