# Editing via Excel

You can use an Excel file as an easy tool to quickly set up DOM objects with states and buttons.

Only a limited set of DOM features can be edited this way:

- Adding fields
- Changing the behavior of fields in a certain state
- Adding buttons
- Adding states if no instances exist of the DOM model

If you want to implement the following changes, you will need to use the [DOM Editor](xref:DOM_Designer_DOM_editor) Automation script instead:

- Changing the name of a field
- Updating the type of a field, e.g. from string to int
- Reusing sections across different definitions in the same module

<!-- TBD: are these last two cases explained under DOM Editor? -->
