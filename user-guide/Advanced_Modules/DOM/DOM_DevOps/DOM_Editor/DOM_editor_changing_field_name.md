# Changing a field name

With the DOM Editor, you can change the name of an existing field.

   When the DOM designer package has been installed, this script will be included in the folder `DOM\DOM Main scripts`.

   The script window will show a list of the available modules, as well as several buttons.

1. Next to the module in which you want to change a field name, click *Edit*.
