# Using the DOM Editor

When you install the DOM DevOps tools package, the *DOM Editor* Automation script is Automatically included in the `DOM\DOM Main scripts` Automation folder.

You can run this script from the Automation module in DataMiner Cube in order to make changes such as [adding a field](xref:DOM_editor_adding_field), [changing a field name](xref:DOM_editor_changing_field_name), [deleting a field](xref:DOM_editor_deleting_field), [adding a button](xref:DOM_editor_adding_button), or [naming a DOM instance](xref:DOM_editor_naming_instance). You can also [create a new module and definition](xref:DOM_editor_new_def) from scratch with it.
