# Using the DOM Editor

When you install the DOM DevOps tools package, the *DOM Editor* Automation script is Automatically included in the `DOM\DOM Main scripts` Automation folder.

You can run this script from the Automation module in DataMiner Cube in order to make changes such as adding a field, changing a field name, deleting a field, adding a button, or naming a DOM instance.
