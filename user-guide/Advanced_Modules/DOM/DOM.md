# DataMiner Object Models (DOM)

DataMiner Object Models can be used for the modeling of any type of administrative or business-related objects within your system. This can for example be planned maintenance records, product catalog data, contractual and customer records, etc. Modeling these using DOM allows you to connect your business workflows to your technical and operational workflows. You can for example use DOM in a custom low-code app or in a dashboard.

A DataMiner Object Model is a generic data storage system that makes it possible to quickly create new applications or solutions. It consists of a collection of generic objects and a generic DOM manager.

> [!NOTE]
> DOM data can be displayed in dashboards and applications from DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards. However, this feature is currently still in soft launch, so you will need to activate the *DOMManager* [soft-launch option](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/soft-launch-options/) to use it.
