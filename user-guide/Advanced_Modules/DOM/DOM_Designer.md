# DOM Designer

The DOM Designer is a tool that allows you to create and update DOM models in a more graphical way instead of doing so via code. It allows you to quickly model DOM objects even if you do not have a profound knowledge of the different objects and how they are structured in the background.

> [!NOTE]
> The DOM designer is a DevOps tool created by developers for developers. We have made this available in case this could be useful, but it is currently by no means a complete tool.

The DOM Designer allows you to make quick edits by means of [an Excel file](xref:DOM_Designer_Excel). However, not all edit actions are possible this way, so for some things you will need to make use of the [DOM Editor]().
