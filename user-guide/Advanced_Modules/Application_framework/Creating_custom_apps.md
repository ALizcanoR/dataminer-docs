# Creating custom applications

> [!NOTE]
> To add, edit, delete, and publish custom applications, you need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps).

To create a new custom application:

1. Go to the DataMiner landing page (see [Accessing custom applications](xref:Accessing_custom_apps)).

1. If no apps exist yet, click *Create a new app*. Otherwise, hover the mouse over the *Other apps* section and click the "+" button next to *Other apps*.

1. Specify the name of your new app in the header bar, instead of the default name "New application".

1. To customize the color and icon for the app, see [Customizing the icon and color of an app](xref:Configuring_custom_apps#customizing-the-icon-and-color-of-an-app).

1. Add the necessary pages with the *Create page* button in the panel on the left, and configure them. See [Configuring a page of a custom app](xref:Configuring_custom_apps#configuring-a-page-of-a-custom-app).

1. To customize who can access or edit the application, see [Configuring custom app security](xref:Configuring_custom_apps#configuring-custom-app-security).

1. When your app is ready, click the ![Publish](~/user-guide/images/AppPublishIcon.png) icon in the header bar to save your changes and publish it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you close a draft app you have been working on, it is saved automatically. As such, if you do not want to publish your app immediately, you can just close it to have it saved as a draft. However, draft apps are not shown by default on the landing page. To view them, click the cogwheel button and activate *Show draft applications*.
