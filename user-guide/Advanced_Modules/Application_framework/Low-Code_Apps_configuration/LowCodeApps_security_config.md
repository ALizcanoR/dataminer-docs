# Configuring security for a low-code app

To configure which users can access and/or edit a low-code application:

1. In the app editor, click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Settings*.

1. In the *Allowed to view the application* box, specify the names of the users and/or groups that should be allowed to view the app.

1. In the *Allowed to edit the application* box, specify the names of the users and/or groups that should be allowed to edit the app.

1. Close the *Settings* window with the X in the top-right corner.

> [!NOTE]
> Security also needs to be configured on DataMiner level. To view, add, edit, delete, or publish low-code applications, users need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps) as well as the [DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission.
