# Advanced analytics in trend graphs

A number of features in trend graphs make use of the artificial intelligence capabilities provided by DataMiner Analytics. These features are only available on systems with a Cassandra database. They can each be activated or deactivated in System Center, via *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*.

These features are:

- [Working with trend predictions](xref:Working_with_trend_predictions)

- [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection)

- [Working with pattern matching](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching)
