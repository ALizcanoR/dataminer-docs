# Monitoring real-time communication between a DMA and an element

There are two ways to monitor the messages being exchanged between a DMA and one of its elements.

The following topics contain more information on monitoring these messages:

- [Connecting to an element using Stream Viewer](Connecting_to_an_element_using_Stream_Viewer.md)

- [Connecting to an element using telnet](Connecting_to_an_element_using_telnet.md)

- [Message syntax](Message_syntax.md)

> [!NOTE]
> -  You can only open a telnet session to monitor an element if that element has a virtual IP address.
> -  Because it connects to elements via the DataMiner client application, Stream Viewer can also connect to elements that do not have a virtual IP address. Therefore, if you have to connect to elements via firewalls or via NAT, always use Stream Viewer.
