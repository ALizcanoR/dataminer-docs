# About the Sharing module

As part of the DataMiner Cloud Platform (DCP), the Sharing module allows DataMiner users to share live data with anybody on the fly.

During the preview stage, you will only be able to share dashboards. However, in the future, this module will also allow you to share metrics, devices, services, user-definable apps and APIs, etc.
