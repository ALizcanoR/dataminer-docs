# About the Project Collaboration module

As part of the DataMiner Cloud Platform (DCP), the Project Collaboration module allows Skyline customers and DataMiner Strategic Partners to keep track of all their ongoing projects ordered from Skyline.

It provides an overview of all deliverables along with their statuses. Deliverables can include software licenses as well as professional services for deployment and configuration of DataMiner solutions, training, consultancy, etc.

For customers with an active DataMiner Maintenance & Support agreement, the Project Collaboration module also provides access to all tickets related to support services.
