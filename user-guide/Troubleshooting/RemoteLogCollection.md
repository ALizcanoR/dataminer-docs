# Remote Log Collection

## What is it?

The Remote Log Collection feature allows our experts to collect DataMiner log and memory dump files without customer assistance, increasing efficiency of investigations.

Currently the packages generated by the LogCollector are being saved on the DataMiner System, but in a future increment these packages will automatically be transferred to a secure storage in the cloud. By doing this, the experts can immediately access the packages without any intervention from our users.

## Requirements

Before this feature can be used your system needs to meet a few requirements.

1. The DataMiner Cloud Services need to be enabled on your system. If this is not yet the case, take a look at the [guide](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud) on how to enable the DataMiner Cloud Services for your agent.
1. Make sure you have installed a Cloud Pack with version 2.8.0 or higher. You can always find the latest Cloud Pack on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
