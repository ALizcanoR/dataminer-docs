# Remote Log Collection

The Remote Log Collection feature allows our experts to collect DataMiner log and memory dump files independently, increasing efficiency of investigations.

Currently, the packages generated by the Log Collector tool are saved on the DataMiner System. However, in a future increment these packages will automatically be transferred to secure storage in the cloud, so that our experts have immediate access to the packages.

## Requirements

To use this feature, your system needs to meet the following requirements:

- The DataMiner Cloud Services need to be enabled on your system. For information on how to enable this, see [Connecting your DataMiner System to the cloud](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).

- Cloud Pack version 2.8.0 or later must be installed. You can always find the latest Cloud Pack on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
