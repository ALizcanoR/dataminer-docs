# Remote Log Collection

## What is it?

The Remote Log Collection feature will allow our experts to instantly gather data from all nodes in your system. The ultimate goal is to enable our them to gather the necessary information from your system without your intervention. With this functionality experts from Skyline can trigger the LogCollector tool remotely, so they can collect the logs and memory dumps they need for their investigation.

Currently the packages generated by the LogCollector are being saved on the DataMiner System, but in a future increment these packages will automatically be transferred to a secure storage in the cloud. By doing this the experts can immediately access the packages without any intervention from our users.

## Requirements

Before this feature can be used your system needs to meet a few requirements.

1. The DataMiner Cloud Services need to be enabled on your system. If this is not yet the case, take a look at the [guide](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud) on how to enable the DataMiner Cloud Services for your agent.
1. Make sure you have installed a Cloud Pack with version 2.8.0 or higher. You can always find the latest Cloud Pack on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
