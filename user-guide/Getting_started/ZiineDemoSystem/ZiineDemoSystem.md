# Ziine Demo System

This section will be dedicated to our Ziine Demo System. It will contain several topics from "how to connect" and "what is available" to "how does this demo work".

## How to connect

In case this is the very first time you connect to a DataMiner system it is possible that you don't have he DataMiner Cube desktop application installed yet. To do so, you first need to log in on [DataMiner Services](https://dataminer.services) with your Dojo account. On the landing page, you can follow the steps described in [Installing the DataMiner Cube desktop application](xref:Installing_configuring_the_DataMiner_Cube_software#Installing-the-DataMiner-Cube-desktop-application).

Once the application has been installed, you can add Agent ziine.skyline.be to your overview and connect to it.
