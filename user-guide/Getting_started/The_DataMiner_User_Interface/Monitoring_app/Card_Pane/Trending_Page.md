# Trending page

The trending page allows you to view a trend graph or histogram for a parameter. You can access the page by clicking the *View trending* option on an [element card](xref:Element_Cards).

On the left, the time span for the trend graph can be configured.

From DataMiner 10.3.3/10.4.0 onwards, the header of a trend card shows a breadcrumb trail. Navigate back to the element card item by clicking it in the breadcrumb trail.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU10]/10.3.1 onwards, the Monitoring app also supports trend graphs for string parameters.
