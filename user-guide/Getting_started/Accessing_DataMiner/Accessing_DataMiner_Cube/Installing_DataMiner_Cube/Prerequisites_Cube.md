# Prerequisites

- Make sure the client machine meets the minimum requirements detailed in the [DataMiner Client Requirements](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-client-requirements/).

- To run DataMiner Cube in Internet Explorer, you must correctly configure the browser so that it is both able to and allowed to run XAML browser applications. See [Configuring Internet Explorer to run DataMiner Cube](xref:Configuring_Internet_Explorer_to_run_DataMiner_Cube).

- To run DataMiner Cube in Microsoft Edge, configure Edge to open the URL of the DMA in Internet Explorer compatibility mode. For more information, see
<https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/internet-explorer-support/>.

- If you intend to run DataMiner Cube in a browser, you are using Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 or an earlier Windows version, and no internet connectivity is available, it is recommended to install the Skyline certificates. See [Installing the Skyline certificates](xref:Installing_the_Skyline_certificates).

> [!NOTE]
> When you connect to DataMiner using HTTPS, TLS 1.0 is required to install Cube. It is also possible to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2, but in that case Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 is required.
