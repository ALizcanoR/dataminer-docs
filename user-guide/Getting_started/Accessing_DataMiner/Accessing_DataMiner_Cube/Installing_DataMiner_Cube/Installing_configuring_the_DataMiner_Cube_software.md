# Installing & configuring the DataMiner Cube software

DataMiner Cube can either be used as a desktop application (recommended) or as a browser application in Internet Explorer or Edge. If you browse to the IP or name of your DMA using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (without IE compatibility mode), Mozilla Firefox or Safari, by default a landing page is displayed where you can download the desktop application. See [Installing the DataMiner Cube desktop application](xref:Installing_the_DataMiner_Cube_desktop_application).

If you want to use DataMiner Cube as a browser application instead, you need to use either Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge in IE compatibility mode. If you use Internet Explorer, we highly recommend not to use this browser for any other purpose than to access DataMiner Cube. To access the browser application, browse to the IP or name of your DMA in a compatible browser. For more information on how to configure your browser, see [Prerequisites](xref:Prerequisites_Cube).

Once the application has been installed, each time you reopen its user interface and connect to a DataMiner Agent, the software version will be checked. If you connect to a DMA with a higher DataMiner version than your current version of Cube, Cube will automatically be updated. If the software version of a DMA changes while you are connected with Cube, a message will appear asking you to either restart (if you use the desktop app) or start a new session (if you use the browser app).

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards, the desktop version of DataMiner Cube runs as a 64-bit process on 64-bit systems and as a 32-bit process on 32-bit systems. If DataMiner Cube is used as a XAML browser application, it always runs as a 32-bit process.
