# DataMiner Indexing Engine

From DataMiner 9.6.4 onwards, on DataMiner Agents with a Cassandra database, it is possible to install a dedicated Elasticsearch indexing database, which is used to store specific data that can for instance be used in the Jobs app and the new Dashboards app.

Certain features introduced from that version of DataMiner onwards, such as the Jobs app, can only be used when the DataMiner Indexing Engine is installed.

The following topics provide more information on the DataMiner Indexing Engine:
