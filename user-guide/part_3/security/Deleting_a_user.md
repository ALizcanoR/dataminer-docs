## Deleting a user

To delete a user from the DMS:

1. In the *Users / Groups* section of the System Center module, go to the *users* tab.

2. Right-click the user in the *Local* or *Domain* list and select *Delete*.

3. In the confirmation window, click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> -  When you delete a local user, the associated Windows user account will also be removed from the DataMiner Agents.
> -  When you delete a manually added domain user, only the reference to that user will be removed from the DataMiner System.
> -  An automatically added domain user cannot be deleted. To remove such users, they must be removed from the domain group.
