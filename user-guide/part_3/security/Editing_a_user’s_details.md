## Editing a user’s details

To edit a user’s details:

1. In the *Users / Groups* section of the System Center module, go to the *users* tab and select the user whose information you want to edit.

    Alternatively, you can also open the user card for the user in question. See [Opening a user card](Opening_a_user_card.md).

2. If you are using a version of DataMiner prior to 9.5.4, in the lower right corner of the *details* tab, click the *Edit* button.

3. Fill in the new data in the applicable fields. E.g. if you want to change a user’s DCP login credentials, fill in *DCP Username* and *DCP Password*.

4. Click the *Apply* button in the lower right corner.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to quickly change your own password, while you are logged in with your account, right-click your name in the *Users / Groups* section of the System Center module, and select *Change password*.
