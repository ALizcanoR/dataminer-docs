# Managing users

In DataMiner Cube, users and user groups are managed in System Center. In addition, to configure settings for one single user, some functionality can be accessed from a user card instead.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Accessing security in System Center](Accessing_security_in_System_Center.md)

- [Opening a user card](Opening_a_user_card.md)

- [Adding a user](Adding_a_user.md)

- [Deleting a user](Deleting_a_user.md)

- [Viewing user information](Viewing_user_information.md)

- [Editing a user’s details](Editing_a_user’s_details.md#editing-a-users-details)

- [Changing group membership of a user](Changing_group_membership_of_a_user.md)

- [Disconnecting a user in DataMiner Cube](Disconnecting_a_user_in_DataMiner_Cube.md)
