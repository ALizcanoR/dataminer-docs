## Accessing security in System Center

Most security settings for users or user groups are configured in the *System Center* module.

To access these settings:

1. In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *System Center.*

2. In the overview panel, click the *Users / Groups* field.

    The *Users / Groups* section opens, with two tabs: *users* and *groups*.
