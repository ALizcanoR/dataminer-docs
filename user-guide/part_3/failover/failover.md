# Failover

Each DataMiner Agent in a DataMiner system can be teamed up with a dedicated backup DMA. Within a DMA Failover team, the backup DMA will continuously be synchronized so that, at all times, it is ready to take over from its team member the moment that one fails.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [About DMA Failover](About_DMA_Failover.md)

- [Viewing Failover information](Viewing_Failover_information.md)

- [Configuring Failover](Configuring_Failover.md)

- [Preferred configuration using virtual IP addresses (best practice)](Preferred_configuration_using_virtual_IP_addresses__best_practice.md)

- [Linking an element to a fixed DMA: Force Agent](Linking_an_element_to_a_fixed_DMA_Force_Agent.md)

- [Synchronizing the DMA databases](Synchronizing_the_DMA_databases.md)

- [Ending a Failover configuration](Ending_a_Failover_configuration.md)

- [Frequently asked questions about DMA Failover](Frequently_asked_questions_about_DMA_Failover.md)
