# Stretching a shape across an entire card

A shape can be stretched across the entire card surface.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When a shape is stretched across the entire card, then the card header, the card navigation pane and the card footer will slowly fade away. Moving the mouse pointer around on the card will make them reappear.
> - For an example of use, refer to the view "Linking Shapes" on the [Ziine Demo System](xref:ZiineDemoSystem). The example can be found on the Visual page _positioning > STRETCH_.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type Stretch to the shape, and set its value to one of the following values:

| Value         | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fill          | Stretches the shape, ignoring the aspect ratio.    |
| UniformToFill | Stretches the shape, maintaining the aspect ratio. |
