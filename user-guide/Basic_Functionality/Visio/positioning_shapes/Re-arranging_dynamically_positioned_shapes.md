# Re-arranging dynamically positioned shapes

When, in a Visio drawing, shapes have been positioned dynamically based on properties, you can re-arrange those shapes manually.

1. Right-click the page, and select _Arrange_. This will activate the special “Arrange” mode.

2. Re-arrange the shapes using drag-and-drop.

3. When you have finished re-arranging the shapes, click _Apply_.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In DataMiner versions prior to 9.0.0, users need to have the permission “Edit Visio drawings” to use this functionality. From version 9.0.0 onwards, this is no longer required.
> - For an example of use, refer to the view "Linking Shapes" on the [Ziine Demo System](xref:ZiineDemoSystem). The example can be found on the Visual page _positioning > DYNAMIC_.
