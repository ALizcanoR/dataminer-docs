# Creating a button to navigate to a page of the current Visio drawing

If a Visio drawing contains multiple pages, you can configure a shape that, when clicked, will make a particular page of the drawing be displayed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For an example of use, refer to the view "Linking Shapes" on the [Ziine Demo System](xref:ZiineDemoSystem). The example can be found on the Visual page _linking > OTHER_.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type **NavigatePage** to the shape, and set its value to the name of the page to be displayed.
