# Implementing drag-and-drop functions

Visio shapes can be configured to perform particular actions when other shapes are dropped on them, or when a user hovers the mouse pointer over them.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Triggering an action when a shape is dragged onto another shape](xref:Triggering_an_action_when_a_shape_is_dragged_onto_another_shape)

- [Triggering an action when the mouse pointer hovers over a shape](xref:Triggering_an_action_when_the_mouse_pointer_hovers_over_a_shape)
