# About services

In DataMiner, you can build a service layer on top of your devices. That way, operators can be offered a “service-centric” view of the network infrastructure.

Services are displayed with the following icon in DataMiner:

- From DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards:

- Prior to DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 (or in case *Use modern icons* is not selected in the user settings):

Services have their own set of properties and their own alarm history. They can also be assigned a Visio file to be displayed on a *Visual* page of a service card. In Visio files, objects can be linked to services just like they can be linked to elements.

The *Data* pages of a service display an overview of its contents. Services can contain entire elements, parts of elements or even other services.

#### Advantages of services

Building a service layer has many advantages:

- You can watch services rather than devices. Service impact of device events is shown in real time.

- You can view your systems from a customer perspective.

- You can interpret the status of your systems much faster.

- You can better assess the impact of an alarm.

- You can drill down from the affected services all the way to the devices in order to analyze issues.

In short, when you focus on services rather than devices, if an alarm is raised, you can substantially reduce the time it takes to restore operations.
