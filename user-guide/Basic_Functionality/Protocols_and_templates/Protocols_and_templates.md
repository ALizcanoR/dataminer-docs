# Protocols and templates

This section provides information on the functionality of the Protocols & Templates module:

- [Protocols](xref:Protocols1#protocols)

- [Information templates](xref:Information_templates)

- [Alarm templates](xref:About_alarm_templates)

- [Trend templates](xref:Trend_templates)

> [!NOTE]
> The Protocols & Templates module often makes use of overlays, for example when you edit a protocol, alarm template or trend template. In that case, an undock icon is displayed in the top right corner, which can be used to open the overlay in a separate window. However, as long as this separate window is open, you will not be able to do any other actions in the Protocols & Templates module.
