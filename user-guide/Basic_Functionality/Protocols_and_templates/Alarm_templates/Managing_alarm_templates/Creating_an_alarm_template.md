# Creating an alarm template

To create a new alarm template:

1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

1. Select a protocol in the first column and a protocol version in the second column.

1. Right-click in the third column under *Alarm*, and select *New*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To create a new alarm template that is very similar to one that already exists, it can be handy to duplicate the existing template instead of creating a blank new template. To do so, instead of selecting *New*, select the template that is similar, and then select *Duplicate* in the right-click menu.

1. In the *New alarm template* dialog box:

   1. Keep *Alarm Template* selected.

   1. Enter a template name.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Some characters cannot be used in template names. For more information, see [Naming of elements, services, views, etc.](xref:NamingConventions#naming-of-elements-services-views-etc).

   1. Check if the protocol and protocol version are correct and adapt if necessary.

   1. Click *OK*.

      The template editor now opens, where you can further configure the alarm template. For more information, see [Configuring regular alarm thresholds](xref:Configuring_alarm_thresholds).
