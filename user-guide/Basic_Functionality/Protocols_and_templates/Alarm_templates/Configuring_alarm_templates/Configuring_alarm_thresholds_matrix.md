To determine the alarm thresholds for matrix parameters:

1. Select the checkbox in the first column for the matrix parameter to enable alarm monitoring for this parameter.

1. In the *Alarm level editor*:

   - To change the alarm level for an empty input or output, select the selection mode *Inputs/Outputs*, select the corresponding circle for the input or output and choose an alarm level.

     The circle you have selected will get the color of the selected alarm level.

   - To change the alarm level for a crosspoint, select the selection mode *Crosspoints*, select the corresponding cell and choose an alarm level.

     The cell you have selected will get the color of the selected alarm level.

   - Select either of the selection modes and click *All* to select all the inputs and outputs, or all the crosspoints, depending on the mode.

   - Click *None* to clear your selection.

> [!NOTE]
> With the matrix parameter alarm level editor, it is possible to set a different alarm level for any input or output, separately, or combined.
