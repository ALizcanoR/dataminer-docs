# Advanced analytics in trend graphs

A number of features in trend graphs make use of the artificial intelligence capabilities provided by DataMiner Analytics. Most of these features are only available on systems with a Cassandra database and can be activated or deactivated in System Center, via *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*.

These features are:

- [Working with trend predictions](xref:Working_with_trend_predictions)

- [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection)

- [Working with pattern matching](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching)

- [Adding related parameters to a trend graph](xref:Adding_related_parameters_to_a_trend_graph)

  > [!NOTE]
  > Adding related parameters to a trend graph is only possible in DataMiner Systems that have been connected to dataminer.services. Unlike the other advanced analytics features, this feature cannot be activated or deactivated in System Center. Cassandra is also not strictly required for this feature, although we highly recommend it.
