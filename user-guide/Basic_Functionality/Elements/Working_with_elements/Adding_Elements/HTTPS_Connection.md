# HTTP(S) connections

For HTTP(S) connections, specify the following connection settings:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. This is not always required. The default port for HTTPS communication is 443. If you specify a different port, also add the *https://* prefix in the IP address field.

- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. This is not always required. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

- **Network**: The network interface (NIC). If only one network interface is available on the DMA, it is automatically selected.
