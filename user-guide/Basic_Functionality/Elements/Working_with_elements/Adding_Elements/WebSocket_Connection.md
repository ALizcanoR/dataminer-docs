# WebSocket connections

For a **WebSocket** connection (available from DataMiner 9.5.3 onwards), specify the following connection settings:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. This is not always required.

- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. This is not always required. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

- **Network**: The network interface (NIC). If only one network interface is available on the DMA, it is automatically selected.
