# Proactive cap detection

This DataMiner Analytics feature predicts future issues based on trend data in the Cassandra database, using advanced techniques that consider repeating patterns, information on the rate at which a parameter value increases or decreases, etc. However, note that some events simply cannot be predicted. For example, a spike in a trend graph caused by randomly pulling out a cable can never be predicted by looking at historical trend data, so proactive cap detection will not know about this in advance.

## Specifications

For the best results, both real-time and average trending should be activated on a parameter for which you want proactive cap detection to be available. To calculate its predictions, DataMiner Analytics will make use of the available real-time data, 5-minute average data, 1-hour average data and daily average data. It can predict at most 200 data points into the future. This is further limited by the available data: if there is a data set of a specific number of points, DataMiner Analytics can never predict further than that number of points divided by ten. For example, if the database contains one year of hourly averages and no daily averages, then DataMiner Analytics computes 365 daily averages and is able to predict issues 36 days into the future.

This feature is currently only available for trended parameters with numeric values, and not for [partial table parameters](xref:Table_parameters#partial-tables). Because of memory constraints, proactive cap detection is also only possible for up to 100 000 parameters per DMA. If there are more parameters for which proactive cap detection would be possible, no predictions will be available for these and the Analytics log file will mention that the number of tracked parameters exceeded the maximum.

In addition, proactive cap detection is currently only supported for parameters for which there are explicitly specified value bounds. It will predict when a parameter will cross one of these bounds:

- A high and/or low data range value specified in the protocol, or,

- A (by default) critical alarm limit of type normal (i.e. not rate or baseline) specified in the alarm template, or,

- A data range indirectly derived from the protocol info. Currently this is limited to the values 0 and 100 for percentage data for which no historical values were encountered outside the \[0,100\] interval.

However, note that in case there is both a data range in the protocol and an alarm threshold in an alarm template, the alarm template will get precedence.

## Proactive cap detection configuration in System Center

In DataMiner Cube, you can enable this feature in System Center, via *System settings* > *analytics config* > *proactive cap detection*. The following settings are available there:

- *Enabled*: Allows you to activate or deactivate this feature.

- *Minimum alarm severity*: Allows you to configure the lowest alarm threshold severity that will be taken into account for proactive cap detection. If this is for example set to *Major*, proactive cap detection will alert the operator whenever a parameter is predicted to go out of range or is predicted to trigger a major or critical alarm.

## Suggestion events

The notifications generated by the proactive cap detection feature are displayed in the suggestion events tab of the Alarm Console, along with the notifications for behavioral anomaly detection (see [Adding and removing alarm tabs in the Alarm Console](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#adding-and-removing-alarm-tabs-in-the-alarm-console)) and pattern matching (see [Monitoring of trend patterns](xref:Monitoring_of_trend_patterns)). These are alarms with severity "Information" and source "Suggestion Engine‚Äù.

The value of the suggestion event mentions what kind of issue is expected, e.g. a critical high or low alarm or an above or below range violation. The value also mentions between which times the issue is expected to occur. The closer to the predicted time, the more accurate this prediction will be, so the suggestion event will be automatically updated with more accurate information when appropriate. As soon as the predicted time of the incident has passed, the suggestion event will be cleared.
