# Using the collapsible side panel of the Alarm Console

For each alarm tab, you can open a side panel in the Alarm Console showing the real-time value and history of a selected alarm.

You can open the side panel of an alarm tab in three ways:

- Right-click an alarm, and select *Show side panel*.

- Select *Show side panel* in the Alarm Console settings menu. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:AlarmConsoleSettings).

- Double-click an alarm in an alarm tab, if the *Alarm double-click action* user setting is set to *Open side panel*. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:User_settings#alarm-console-settings).

In the side panel:

- The top section contains the name of the element in alarm and an overview of its alarm state in the last twenty-four hours. Click this section to open the element card.

- Below this is the parameter section, which contains the current value of the parameter and an overview of the parameter state in the last twenty-four hours. If the parameter in alarm is trended, click this section to see the trend graph.

- The bottom section displays more information about the alarms in the alarm tree.

You can hide the side panel in three ways:

- Right-click an alarm, and select *Hide side panel*.

- Clear the selection from *Show side panel* in the Alarm Console settings menu. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:AlarmConsoleSettings).

- Double-click an alarm in the alarm tab, if the *Alarm double-click action* user setting is set to *Open side panel*. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:User_settings#alarm-console-settings).

> [!NOTE]
> The setting that controls whether the side panel is shown or hidden is a tab setting. This means that you can show the side panel in one tab and hide it in another. It is also a user setting that is remembered across sessions.
