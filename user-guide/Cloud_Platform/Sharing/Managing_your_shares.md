# Managing your shares

In the Sharing module, you can view the items that are currently being shared with you.

- Use the filter box in the top-right corner to quickly find a specific item.

- Click a shared dashboard in the list to view this dashboard.

- Click the expand button to the right of an item to view more detailed information, such as the person who shared the item with you and the date when it was shared with you.

We will soon add the possibility to delete a share in this module, so that you will be able to choose to stop sharing an item.
