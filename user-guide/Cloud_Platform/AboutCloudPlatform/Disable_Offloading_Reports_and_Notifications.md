# Disable Offloading Reports and Notifications

From version 1.3.1 of the [DataMiner SupportAssistant](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules#supportassistant) DataMiner Extension Module (DxM) onwards, this DxM also takes care of offloading Reports and Notifications (generated by SLWatchDog) to the DataMiner Cloud Platform to guarantee a better maintenance and support experience.

By default, the *FileWatcherOptions:Configs* are configured to offload both Reports and Notifications.

You can **remove** entries from that array for each DataMiner SupportAssistant by overriding the configuration:

1. On each server with DataMiner SupportAssistant installed, in the folder `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner SupportAssistant`, create or adjust the override *appsettings.custom.json* with the following contents to disable all offloading:

   ```json
   {
      "FileWatcherOptions": {
         "Configs": []
      }
   }
   ```
  
1. Restart DataMiner SupportAssistant on each server for the changes to take effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - At this moment in time the feature runs in parallel with the old way of offloading via an SMTP server and thus there is no possiblity yet to eliminate those.
> - Disabling the offload of Reports and Notifications will also eliminate Skyline to provide maintenance and support.
