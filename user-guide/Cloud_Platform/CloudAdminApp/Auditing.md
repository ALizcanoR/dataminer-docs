# Auditing

>[!NOTE]
> The *Audit* page is only visible for users with the `Owner` or `Admin` role on the Organization.

In the Admin app you can find the *Audit* page for your organization. Here you will find an overview of all the security related events that have happened on all Cloud Connected systems within your Organization.

To make sure that you can quickly find your way around in the vast amount of logs, you have some filters available at the top.
