# Consulting DCP audit logs

If you have the Owner or Admin role for an organization on DCP, you can consult DCP audit logs on the *Organization* > *Audit* page in the DCP app.

This page shows an overview of all the security-related events on DCP that have happened for all cloud-connected systems within your organization.

To quickly find something in the potentially vast number of logs, use the filters at the top of the page.
