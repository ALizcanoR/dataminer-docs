# Giving users access to cloud features

Before users can have access to a DataMiner System via the various cloud features (e.g. remote access, Teams bot, etc.), you must add their DataMiner Cloud Platform account to your organization and to the DataMiner System.

To do so:

1. As the owner or administrator of your organization, open the Admin app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When a DataMiner System is connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform, the user configuring the connection selects or creates an organization. The DataMiner System is then considered part of the specified organization. If a new organization is created, the person creating it is automatically considered to be its owner.

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.
