> To be able to access a DMS remotely, users must be granted access to cloud features. See [Controlling user access to cloud features](xref:Giving_users_access_to_cloud_features). They also need to have the [General > DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission, as well as any other user permissions required to access specific apps.
