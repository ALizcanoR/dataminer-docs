# Controlling remote access with the Admin app

When a DMS is cloud-connected, you can use the URL created for you during registration (e.g. ``https://ziine-skyline.on.dataminer.services/``) to access the DataMiner web apps from anywhere.

## Finding the remote access URL

After you have registered, you can find the remote-access URL in the Admin app:

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. Click DataMiner Systems in the pane on the left, and then select your DataMiner System in the main pane.

   The URL that can be used for remote access will be displayed on the left.

## Enabling or disabling remote access

If you have the Owner or Admin role on DCP, you can enable or disable the remote access feature.

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.
