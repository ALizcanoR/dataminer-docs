| CountryCode             | The two-digit ISO country code.<br> DataMiner tries to transform all phone numbers to internationally formatted phone numbers. If no country code is found in the phone number itself, the value of this tag will be added to the number.<br> -  In your DataMiner System, it is strongly advised to enter all telephone numbers in international format (starting with a “+” sign).<br> -  In DMS versions prior to version 8.5.6 this tag was named *LandCode*.<br> Default: 32 (Belgium)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| DMALostAfter            | Every DataMiner Agent regularly sends an MGN_I\_AM_STILL_ONLINE notification to Mobile Gateway.
