# Manually starting and stopping a scheduled event

Even if an event has been scheduled to be executed at a different time, whether this is in the past or in the future, it is possible to manually start and stop the event at any moment.

To do so:

1. In the *Scheduler*Â module, go to the *timeline \> EVENTS* tab.

2. Right-click the colored rectangle indicating the task on the timeline. In the right-click menu:

    - To immediately start a task, select *Manual start*.

    - To immediately stop a task that is being executed, select *Manual stop*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you manually execute a scheduled start or stop task at a particular time, the task will be executed again at the time when it was originally scheduled. However, note that in DataMiner versions prior to 9.0.0 CU9, the manual execution will instead replace the scheduled execution.
