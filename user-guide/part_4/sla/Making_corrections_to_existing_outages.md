# Making corrections to existing outages

It is possible that a particular outage or alarm should not or only partly be taken into account for an SLA. In that case, you can make corrections afterwards:

- [Correcting an outage in the outage list](Correcting_an_outage_in_the_outage_list.md)

- [Excluding alarms that affect the SLA](Excluding_alarms_that_affect_the_SLA.md)
