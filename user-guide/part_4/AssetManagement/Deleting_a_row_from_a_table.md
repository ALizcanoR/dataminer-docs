## Deleting a row from a table

In the *Asset Manager *module, there are several ways to delete a row from a table:

- From the table in the *Normal View*:

    1. In the *Normal view* tab on the left, select the table.

    2. In the data pane on the right, select the row to be deleted, and click *Delete Row*.

- From a table row in the *All linked items* view:

    1. In the overview pane on the left, select the table row.

    2. If not in *All linked items*Â view, click *All linked items* at the top of the data pane.

    3. Select the row again in the pane on the right, and click the *Delete row* button.

When you try to delete a row, depending on the configuration, a confirmation box may appear, mentioning the row you want to delete along with any rows linked to it. If you do not have permission to delete the row, a message box will appear to tell you that your request has been denied.
