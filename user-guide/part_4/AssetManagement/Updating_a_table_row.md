## Updating a table row

In the *Asset Manager* module, there are several ways to update a table row:

- From the table in the *Normal View*:

    1. While a table is selected in the *Normal view* tab on the left, select the row in the pane on the right.

    2. Click the *Edit row* button.

    3. Make the necessary changes and click *Apply*.

- From a table row in the *All linked items* view:

    1. In the overview pane on the left, select the table row.

    2. If not in *All linked items* view, click *All linked items* at the top of the data pane.

    3. Select the row again in the pane on the right, and click the *Edit row* button.

    4. Make the necessary changes and click *Apply*.

- From the table row in the *Row View*:

    1. In the overview pane on the left, select the table row.

    2. If not in *Row View*, click *Row View* at the top of the data pane.

    3. In the *Value* column, make the necessary changes.

        To update a cell, click inside it and change the value as required.

> [!NOTE]
> - When you select a table in the tree structure on the left, you can update data directly in the table grid on the right. Just click inside a cell and change its value.
> - If a field in a row has a link to a foreign table, the possible values are shown in a combo box. You can also add a new row to the foreign table by selecting *Add new row* in the combo box.
> - It is not possible to edit fields containing a primary key. Editing of foreign keys is only possible via the *Edit row* button.
> - From DataMiner 9.0.3 onwards, columns of type “Bool” and of type “Enum” are supported. Values in these columns are displayed as a checkbox and as a selection box, respectively.
