# Configuring data mediation settings in DMS Inventory and Asset Management

The DMS Inventory & Asset Management module supports two-way data synchronization between a DataMiner database and a third-party CMDB.

On a DataMiner Agent, the configuration settings for this so-called data mediation have to be specified in XML files, located in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\AssetManager\\MediationConfigs*Â directory, which have to be linked to an Asset Manager configuration file.

More information on the configuration of these files is included in the following sections:

- [Tags in the Asset Manager mediation configuration file](Tags_in_the_Asset_Manager_mediation_configuration_file.md)

- [Example of an Asset Manager mediation configuration file](Example_of_an_Asset_Manager_mediation_configuration_file.md)
