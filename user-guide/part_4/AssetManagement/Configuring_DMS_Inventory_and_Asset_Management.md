# Configuring DMS Inventory and Asset Management

On a DataMiner Agent, all configuration settings of the DataMiner Inventory and Asset Management module have to be specified in an XML file located in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\AssetManager\\Configs* directory. Once this XML file has been configured, the Asset Management database needs to be activated in DataMiner Cube.

More information is included in the following sections:

- [Tags in the Asset Manager configuration file](Tags_in_the_Asset_Manager_configuration_file.md)

- [Example of an Asset Manager configuration file](Example_of_an_Asset_Manager_configuration_file.md)

- [Activating the Asset Management database in Cube](Activating_the_Asset_Management_database_in_Cube.md)
