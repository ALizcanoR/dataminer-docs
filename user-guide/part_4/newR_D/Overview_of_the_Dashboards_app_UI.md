# Overview of the Dashboards app UI

You can access the new Dashboards app via the link *https://\[MyDataMiner\]/dashboard* or *http://\[MyDataMiner\]/dashboard*, depending on your setup.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend to use Google Chrome to access the Dashboards app. Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari are also supported.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you use a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.1.7, we strongly advise to use HTTPS when you use DataMiner client applications over public internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – is sent as plain, unencrypted text over the internet. From DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards, client-server communication is encrypted by default. See also: [Setting up HTTPS on a DMA](../../part_3/DataminerAgents/General_DMA_configuration.md#setting-up-https-on-a-dma).

In DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2, the UI of the app has been redesigned. Below, you can find more information:
