## Configuring feed components

To have a component depend on feed selector components for its data input:

1. Add the feed component(s) you want to the dashboard. For an overview of the available components, see [Feeds](Feeds.md).

2. Use the feeds as a data feed. See [Applying a data feed](Configuring_dashboard_components.md#applying-a-data-feed).

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.0.7 onwards, it is possible to have a dashboard depend on a URL feed without containing any feed components. See [Configuring a dashboard to use a URL feed without a feed component](Configuring_a_dashboard_to_use_a_URL_feed_without_a_feed_component.md).
