# Viewing the reports page on a card

Many cards in DataMiner Cube have a *Reports* page. To go to this page:

- on a view card, service card or element card, go to the *Reports* page, or

- for reports on one particular parameter, on a data page of an element card, double-click the parameter and then go to the *Details* tab.

More information on the Reports page can be found in the following sections:

- [Reports page overview](Reports_page_overview.md)

- [Exporting the report information](Exporting_the_report_information.md)
