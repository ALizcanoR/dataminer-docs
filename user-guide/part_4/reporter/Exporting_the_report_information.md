## Exporting the report information

For each of the graphs, the information can be exported as a .csv file.

To do so:

1. Click the spreadsheet icon in the lower right corner next to the graph.

2. Browse to the location where you want to save the exported file, optionally specify a custom file name, and click *Save*.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.0.4 onwards, the CSV separator will by default be the separator defined in the Cube user settings. See [Regional settings](../../part_1/GettingStarted/User_settings.md#regional-settings). If this setting cannot be retrieved, the system will fall back to the Windows regional settings on the DataMiner Agent.
