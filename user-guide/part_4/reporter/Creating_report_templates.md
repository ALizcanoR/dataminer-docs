# Creating report templates

It is possible to create new custom report templates in the Reporter app.

More information about this can be found in the following sections:

- [Accessing the report templates](Accessing_the_report_templates.md)

- [Adding a new report template](Adding_a_new_report_template.md)

These report templates can then be used to:

- Generate reports with the Reporter app. See [Report template components](Report_template_components.md).

- Send email reports with other DataMiner apps. See [Sending reports by email](Sending_reports_by_email.md).
