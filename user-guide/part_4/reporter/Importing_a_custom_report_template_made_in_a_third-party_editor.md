1. On a DataMiner Agent, copy the ASP page to the following directory:

    - *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Reports\\Templates\\*

2. On the report templates page, click *add new custom report*.

3. In the *Template to add* box, select the template.

4. In the *Description* box, enter a template description. This description will appear on the actual report.

5. In the *Elements needed*, *Parameters needed* and *Aggregation rules needed* boxes, specify how many of each are needed as input.

6. In the *Navigation Menu* box, select one of the following options:

    - *Not displayed*: the report template will not be shown in the navigation menu of the Reports & Templates app.

    - *Link to Template*: in the navigation menu, a link to the report template will be shown.

    - *Link to Report*: in the navigation menu, a link to the report itself will be shown.

7. Click *Add Template*.
