# Legacy Dashboard Gateway installation

It is possible to give users access to the legacy DataMiner Dashboards even if they do not have access to DataMiner, by means of a DMS Dashboard Gateway.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Installing a DMS Dashboard Gateway](Installing_a_DMS_Dashboard_Gateway.md)

- [Adding a Dashboards User to the DMS](Adding_a_Dashboards_User_to_the_DMS.md)

- [Configuring dashboard access rights](Configuring_dashboard_access_rights.md)

- [Dashboard Gateway troubleshooting](Dashboard_Gateway_troubleshooting.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy Dashboard Gateway only supports the legacy Dashboards app, not the new app available from DataMiner 9.6.9 onwards. For a Dashboard Gateway supporting the new app, see [Dashboard Gateway installation](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_installation).
