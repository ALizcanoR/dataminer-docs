## Running an analyzer

To run a Correlation analyzer:

1. In the Correlation module, select the analyzer in the tree view of the *analyzers* pane.

2. Click the *Start analyzing* button at the bottom of the details pane.

3. If the option *Enable real-time analyzing* wasnâ€™t selected, select a time range for the history alarms you want to analyze and click *Apply*.

    While the analyzer is working, its status will change from *Idle* to *Collecting*.

4. To stop real-time analyzing, click *Stop analyzing*. Analysis of history alarms will stop automatically as soon as the analyzer is ready.

    The status of the analyzer will return to *Idle*, and a Correlation rule will be proposed under *Results*.

5. To view the proposed Correlation rule, right-click the result and select *Add to correlation*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The new Correlation rule is not automatically enabled and saved.
