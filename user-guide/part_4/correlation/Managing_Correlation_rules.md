# Managing Correlation rules

When you open the Correlation module in Cube (via apps \> *Correlation*), a card is opened that consists of two panes:

- A pane on the left, where all rules are represented in a tree view. A search box at the top of the pane allows you to quickly find a particular rule. Rules that are not enabled are indicated in gray.

- A pane on the right, with details of the selected item in the tree view. If a folder is selected, the rules in the folder are shown, with rules that are not enabled indicated in gray. If a rule is selected, its details can be viewed and edited.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The rule details can also be viewed in a separate card. To do so, right-click the rule and select *Open in new card*Â or *Open in new undocked card*.

Managing Correlation rules, e.g. adding and deleting rules or organizing them in folders, is done in the pane on the left:

- [Collapsing and expanding folders](Collapsing_and_expanding_folders.md)

- [Adding a new folder](Adding_a_new_folder.md)

- [Moving rules or folders](Moving_rules_or_folders.md)

- [Deleting a rule or folder](Deleting_a_rule_or_folder.md)

- [Renaming a folder](Renaming_a_folder.md)

- [Adding a new Correlation rule](Adding_a_new_Correlation_rule.md)

- [Testing a Correlation rule](Testing_a_Correlation_rule.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To enable or disable a rule, select the rule in the tree view, and then either select or clear the checkbox next to *Enable this rule*, in the top-left corner of the pane on the right.
