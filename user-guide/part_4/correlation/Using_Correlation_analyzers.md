# Using Correlation analyzers

It is possible for DataMiner to analyze the alarms occurring over a period of time, and then propose a Correlation rule based on this analysis.

The so-called analyzers that are used for this purpose can be found in a second tab in the *Correlation*Â module in Cube, i.e. the *Analyzers* tab.
