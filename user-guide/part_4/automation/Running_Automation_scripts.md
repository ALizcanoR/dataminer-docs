# Running Automation scripts

Once a script has been designed, it can be executed in several ways:

- Manually: a one-time execution from a Visual Overview or from the *Automation* module. See [Manually executing a script](Manually_executing_a_script.md) and [Script execution options](Script_execution_options.md).

- With DMS Scheduler: scripts can be run automatically at certain predefined points in time. See [DMS Scheduler](xref:scheduler#dms-scheduler).

- With DMS Correlation: scripts can be run automatically whenever user-defined events occur. See [Running an Automation script from a Correlation rule](xref:Running_an_Automation_script_from_a_Correlation_rule).
