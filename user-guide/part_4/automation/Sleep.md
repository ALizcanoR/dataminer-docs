# Sleep

Use this action to pause an Automation script for a particular period of time before it is allowed to continue.

To determine how long the script has to pause, click the underlined section and specify a number of milliseconds. By default, the time will be set to 1000 ms.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to add this action within a C# block in a script. For more information, see [Sleep](xref:Engine_methods#sleep).
