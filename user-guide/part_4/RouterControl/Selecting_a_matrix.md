## Selecting a matrix

At the top of the *Router Control*Â module, underneath the gray header area, you will find a list of all matrix elements in the DataMiner System. Click one of them, and the default configuration (i.e. user interface) for that particular matrix will appear:

- At the top: a grid with all the inputs.

- At the bottom: a grid with all the outputs.

- At the center:

    - two information panels (the left one showing information about the selected input, and the right one showing information about the selected output), and

    - three buttons (Connect, Disconnect, and Lock/Unlock).
