## Accessing the Experience and Performance Management user interface

To access the EPM user interface

- Click an EPM element in the Surveyor to open the EPM user interface in a card, or

- Right-click an EPM alarm in the Alarm Console and select *Open \> \[EPM element name\]*. The EPM card will be opened, with the first chain where the table of the alarm occurs selected. Filters will be filled in automatically, so that you can see the information relevant to the alarm.

> [!NOTE]
> -  It is only possible to access the data pages of most EPM cards if you are logged in as Administrator. Even then, you will need to click *Load* before the pages are displayed. Opening these data pages is not advisable, as this can have serious consequences for your system.
> -  An EPM element will by default always show a Visual Overview page when it is opened, even if a default Data Display page is defined in the protocol.
