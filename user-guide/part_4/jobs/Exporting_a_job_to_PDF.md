# Exporting a job to PDF

To create a PDF report of a job:

1. Select the job on the main page of the app (either in the list view or on the timeline).

2. In the header bar, click *Export*.

3. Depending on your browser settings, you may then need to select where the report needs to be stored. Alternatively, it may also be stored automatically in your usual downloads folder.
