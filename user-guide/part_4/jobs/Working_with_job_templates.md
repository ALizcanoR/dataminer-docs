# Working with job templates

From DataMiner 9.6.6 onwards, it is possible to save a particular job configuration as a job template. This way you can later apply the template to immediately fill in the configured values.

> [!NOTE]
> The default fields *Name*, *Start Time* and *Stop Time*, as well as any auto-increment or booking fields are not included in job templates.

#### Saving a job template

1. Create a job, applying the configuration you would like to have in the template, but do not save it.

3. Specify a name for the template.

4. In case you want this template to replace an existing template, in the filter box, select the template you want to replace.

5. Click *Save* or *Update*, depending on the selected options.
