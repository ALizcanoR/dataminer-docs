# Amazon OpenSearch Service

From DataMiner 10.3 [CU0]/10.3.2 onwards, it is possible to Amazon OpenSearch Service on AWS as an alternative to a on-prem hosted Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster.

## Compatibility

Supported versions:

- OpenSearch version 1.3.
- OpenSearch version 2.3.

> [!NOTE]
> No Elasticsearch setups on Amazon OpenSearch Service are currently supported.

## Create your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain

1. Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.
1. Go to [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/).
1. Create your domain

![Create Domain](~/user-guide/images/Amazon_OpenSearch_CreateDomain.png)

Configure your domain with the appropriate settings.
Make sure to select `Production` for `Deployment type`, a supported OpenSearch version and at least 3 nodes.

Keep `compatibility mode` disabled.

For access policy, choose `Only use fine-grained access control`.

In the fine-grained access control settings, choose `Create master user`.

Provide a user name and password. Make sure to store this information somewhere as you are going to need it later to connect from Cube.

New domains typically take 15â€“30 minutes to initialize, but can take longer depending on the configuration. After your domain initializes, select it to open its configuration pane.

Note the domain endpoint under General information.

## Connect your DMS to your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain

To configure the connection to an Amazon OpenSearch Service database, configure the settings as detailed under [Amazon OpenSearch Service database](xref:Configuring_the_database_settings_in_Cube#amazon-opensearch-service-database)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An Amazon OpenSearch Service database requires a separate Cassandra cluster or Amazon Keyspaces database.
