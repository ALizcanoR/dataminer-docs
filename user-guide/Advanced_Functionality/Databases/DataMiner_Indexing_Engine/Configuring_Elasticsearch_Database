# Configuring the Elasticsearch Database

## Configuring a separate Elasticsearch instance on Linux

To configure a separate Elasticsearch instance on Linux the Elasticsearch.yml, as well as several other files may need to be adapted before starting the Elasticsearch service. These settings can be found explained on [Configuring Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/settings.html).
The most important of these can be found on [Important Elasticsearch configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/important-settings.html)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is imperative that the JVM Heap Space is set to a value larger than the default 1 Gb on Production systems.
To configure this, please see [Setting the heap size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/heap-size.html)

## Configuring a new node to be added to the cluster

Please see [DataMiner DOJO - Adding an Elasticsearch cluster node](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/adding-an-elasticsearch-cluster-node/)

## Configuring a new node to be removed from the cluster

Please see [DataMiner DOJO - Removing an Elasticsearch cluster node](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/removing-an-elasticsearch-cluster-node/)

## Configuration of the master nodes

Please see [DataMiner DOJO - Elasticsearch master nodes](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/elasticsearch-cluster-master-nodes/)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A correct master node configuration is extremely important since master nodes logically determine which nodes are part of the cluster. Therefore this is a must read before setting up any Elasticsearch cluster.
