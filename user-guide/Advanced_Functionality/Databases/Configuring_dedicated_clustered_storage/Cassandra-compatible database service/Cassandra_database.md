# Cassandra Cluster

In this section of the documentation, you can find instructions on [how to deploy a Cassandra cluster database](xref:Installing_Cassandra). Deploying a Cassandra cluster setup is the first step in configuring dedicated clustered storage.

A different Cassandra-compatible database service that can be used as an alternative to the Cassandra cluster setup is the [Amazon Keyspaces Service](xref:Amazon_Keyspaces_Service) (Available from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards).

For more information on how to monitor your database, keep your nodes repaired, and keep your software up to date, see [Maintaining a Cassandra cluster](xref:Maintain_Cassandra_Cluster)
