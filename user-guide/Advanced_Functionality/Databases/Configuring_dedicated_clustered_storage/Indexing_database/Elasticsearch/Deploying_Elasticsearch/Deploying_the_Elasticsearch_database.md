# Deploying the Elasticsearch database

To complete the configuration of a dedicated clustered storage setup, when a Cassandra-compatible database service has been set up, you can deploy an Elasticsearch database.

In that case, you will need to [install](xref:Installing_Elasticsearch_on_separate_Linux_machine) and [configure the Elasticsearch database](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_Database) outside of DataMiner. You can also [configure multiple Elasticsearch clusters](xref:Configuring_multiple_Elasticsearch_clusters).

As an alternative to the Elasticsearch database, from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards, [OpenSearch](xref:OpenSearch_database) and the [Amazon OpenSearch Service](xref:Amazon_OpenSearch_Service) are also supported.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the system requirements for Elasticsearch, refer to [DataMiner Compute Requirements](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements).
