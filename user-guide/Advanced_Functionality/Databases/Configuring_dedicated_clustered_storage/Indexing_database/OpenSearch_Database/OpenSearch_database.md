# OpenSearch database

To complete the configuration of a dedicated clustered storage setup, when a Cassandra-compatible database service has been set up, you can install a dedicated OpenSearch indexing database cluster.

Alternatives to the OpenSearch database are the [Elasticsearch database](xref:Elasticsearch_database) and the [Amazon OpenSearch Service](xref:Amazon_OpenSearch_Service).

For more information on how to **install an OpenSearch database**, see [Installing an OpenSearch database](xref:Installing_OpenSearch_database).

From DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards, you can have data offloaded to **multiple OpenSearch clusters**. For more information on how to configure this setup, see [Configuring multiple OpenSearch clusters](xref:Configuring_multiple_OpenSearch_clusters).

This setup is supported from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking to use the Amazon OpenSearch Service instead of on-premises hosted OpenSearch nodes, see [Amazon OpenSearch Service](xref:Amazon_OpenSearch_Service).
