# Deploying the Amazon OpenSearch Service

From DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards, it is possible to use Amazon OpenSearch Service on AWS as an alternative to an on-premises hosted Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the service is named after OpenSearch, it offers both OpenSearch and Elasticsearch clusters.

## Compatibility

Supported versions:

- Elasticsearch version 6.8
- OpenSearch version 1.X
- OpenSearch version 2.X

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner currently does not support Elasticsearch version 7.X setups.
