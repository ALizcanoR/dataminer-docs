# Deploying the Elasticsearch database

From DataMiner 9.6.4 onwards, an Elasticsearch database can be deployed to complete the configuration of a dedicated clustered storage, which consists of a Cassandra-compatible database service and a Search Cluster.

The following procedures are described in this section:

- [Configuring the Elasticsearch database](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_Database)

- [Configuring multiple Elasticsearch clusters](xref:Configuring_multiple_Elasticsearch_clusters)

- [Manually connecting a DMA to an Elasticsearch cluster](xref:Manually_Connecting_DMA_to_Elasticsearch_Cluster)

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the system requirements for Elasticsearch, refer to [DataMiner Compute Requirements](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-compute-requirements/).
