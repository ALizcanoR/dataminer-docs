## MySQL database

On legacy DataMiner Systems, typically a MySQL (or MSSQL) database is used as the general database. For the currently supported DataMiner versions, a Cassandra database is preferred instead. Though DataMiner can still be used with a MySQL or MSSQL database, switching to Cassandra is highly recommended as it leads to enhanced performance, and certain DataMiner features are only available if a Cassandra database is used.
