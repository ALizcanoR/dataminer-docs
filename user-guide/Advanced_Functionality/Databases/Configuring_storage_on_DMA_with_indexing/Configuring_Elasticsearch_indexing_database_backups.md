# Configuring 

Configuring an Elasticsearch indexing database backup is done in the same way as configuring Elasticsearch database backups. See [Configuring Elasticsearch backups](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups). For additional information on backing up a DataMiner Agent, refer to [Backing up a DataMiner Agent](xref:Backing_up_a_DataMiner_Agent).
