# Deploying a dedicated Elasticsearch indexing database

From DataMiner 9.6.4 onwards, on DataMiner Agents with a Cassandra database, it is possible to install a dedicated Elasticsearch indexing database, which is used to store specific data that can for instance be used in the Jobs app and the new Dashboards app.

Certain features introduced from that version of DataMiner onwards, such as the Jobs app, can only be used in DataMiner Systems with Elasticsearch database.
