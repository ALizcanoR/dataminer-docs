# Configuring a dedicated indexing database

If your DataMiner System uses a Cassandra database per DataMiner Agent, you can also install a dedicated Elasticsearch indexing database in order to get access to additional DataMiner features, including:

- DataMiner Advanced Analytics features such as pattern matching
- The Generic Query Interface in DataMiner Dashboards
- DataMiner Object Models (DOM)
- DataMiner Service & Resource Management
- DataMiner User-Defined APIs

You can [deploy the Elasticsearch indexing database](xref:Installing_Elasticsearch_via_DataMiner) via DataMiner Cube. When the database has been deployed, you can also [configure the indexing settings](xref:Configuring_DataMiner_Indexing) in DataMiner Cube.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the system requirements for Elasticsearch, refer to [DataMiner Compute Requirements](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-compute-requirements/).
