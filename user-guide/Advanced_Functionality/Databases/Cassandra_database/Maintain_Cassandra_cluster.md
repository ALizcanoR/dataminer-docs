# Maintaining Cassandra

To ensure your Cassandra database is running fine, we highly recommend to use the [Apache Cassandra Cluster Monitor](https://catalog.dataminer.services/result/driver/7500) connector.
Keep your Cassandra cluster up to date by upgrading your software regularly. Rolling upgrades are possible, so that you can upgrade the Cassandra DB without any downtime.
