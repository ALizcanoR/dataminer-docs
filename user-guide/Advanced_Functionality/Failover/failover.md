# Failover

Each DataMiner Agent in a DataMiner system can be teamed up with a dedicated backup DMA. Within a DMA Failover team, the backup DMA will continuously be synchronized so that, at all times, it is ready to take over from its team member the moment that one fails.

- [About DMA Failover](xref:About_DMA_Failover)
