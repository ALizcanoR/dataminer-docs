# DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs)

## Introduction

A DataMiner Extension Module is a service that can be installed, upgraded and uninstalled without the need to reboot the DataMiner Agent. These modules will expand the core DataMiner software with additional features and capabilities.

## Packs

For ease of installation DataMiner Extension Modules might be packaged together in a Pack. An example of such a pack is the [Cloud Pack](xref:CloudPackages). These Packs will bundle different DxMs together and allow our users to install them all at once.
