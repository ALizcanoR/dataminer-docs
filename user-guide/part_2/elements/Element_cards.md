## Element cards

To open an element card, click an element in the Surveyor. You can also open elements in other ways, for example by right-clicking an element on a view card and selecting *Open*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you expand a service in the Surveyor and click one of its child elements, the service card will be displayed instead, with the data page of this particular element selected. See [Service card pages](../services/Service_card_pages.md).

Element cards can look quite different depending on the element protocol. However, the following characteristics return for all cards.

- By default, the header of an element card shows a breadcrumb trail. You can navigate to a parent item by clicking it in the breadcrumb trail, and you can click the triangle to the right of an item to drill down to its child items.

- The footer of an element card consists of different sections:

    - *measurements/s*: The number of measurements per second done for this element.

    - *24h availability*: Double-click this section to view detailed availability information in the Scheduler module.

    - *Last 24h alarm state*: Shows the alarm state for the last 24 hours. Double-click this section to view reports on the element’s alarm state.

    If an element is in timeout, locked or paused, a status message will be displayed on top of these sections.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your user settings, the breadcrumb trail and/or card footer may not be displayed. See [Card settings](../../part_1/GettingStarted/User_settings.md#card-settings).

- In the navigation pane on the left, a tree view is displayed with all the available pages.

    The items in this tree view and the parameters shown on the card depend on the element protocol. However, all cards share the following pages:

    | Page             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

    | GENERAL PARAMETERS | General parameters for the element, such as its lock status, number of alarms, connection state, etc. See [General parameters](../parameters/General_parameters.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | ANNOTATIONS        | Page where more extensive annotations can be added and viewed. With the pencil icon on this page, you can open an HTML editor that allows you to add text, hyperlinks, pictures, etc. to the annotations. There is also an icon that can be used to print the annotations, and an icon to refresh the annotations page.<br> From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.12 onwards, annotations are no longer available by default in new DataMiner installations. To enable them, set the soft-launch option *LegacyAnnotations* to true. See *[soft-launch options](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/soft-launch-options/)*. |
    | HELP               | Help page for the protocol of the element. This page is only displayed if such a help page is available for the protocol (from DataMiner 9.5.7 onwards).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
