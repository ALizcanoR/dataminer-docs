# Positioning shapes dynamically

There are several ways to configure shapes in Visio so that they are positioned dynamically in Visual Overview.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Positioning shapes dynamically](Positioning_shapes_dynamically1.md#positioning-shapes-dynamically)

- [Positioning shapes in a grid layout](Positioning_shapes_in_a_grid_layout.md)

- [Re-arranging dynamically positioned shapes](Re-arranging_dynamically_positioned_shapes.md#re-arranging-dynamically-positioned-shapes)

- [Docking a shape to one or more borders of a Visio drawing](Docking_a_shape_to_one_or_more_borders_of_a_Visio_drawing.md)

- [Stretching a shape across an entire card](Stretching_a_shape_across_an_entire_card.md)
