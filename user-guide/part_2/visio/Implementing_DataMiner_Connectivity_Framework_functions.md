# Implementing DataMiner Connectivity Framework functions

The DataMiner Connectivity Framework is used to configure and visualize signal paths. In and out interfaces can be defined in element protocols, making it possible to create internal and external connections. These connections can be displayed in several ways in Visual Overview.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Automatically displaying external and internal connections](Automatically_displaying_external_and_internal_connections.md)

- [Options for displaying DCF connections](Options_for_displaying_DCF_connections.md)

- [Options for highlighting DCF connections](Options_for_highlighting_DCF_connections.md)

- [Highlighting a connection chain based on a filter shape](Highlighting_a_connection_chain_based_on_a_filter_shape.md)

- [Creating a selection box with all elements in a connectivity chain](Creating_a_selection_box_with_all_elements_in_a_connectivity_chain.md)

- [Dynamically generating shapes for elements that are out of scope](Dynamically_generating_shapes_for_elements_that_are_out_of_scope.md)

- [Dynamically generating shapes for elements connected to views out of scope](Dynamically_generating_shapes_for_elements_connected_to_views_out_of_scope.md)

- [Applying conditional connection thickness](Applying_conditional_connection_thickness.md)

- [Linking a shape to an element based on DCF connections](Linking_a_shape_to_an_element_based_on_DCF_connections.md)

- [Generating the DCF signal path of a particular element and interface](Generating_the_DCF_signal_path_of_a_particular_element_and_interface.md)

- [Generating the connectivity chain for an SRM service instance](Generating_the_connectivity_chain_for_an_SRM_service_instance.md)

- [Filtering connections based on connection properties](Filtering_connections_based_on_connection_properties.md)
