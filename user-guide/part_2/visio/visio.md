# Visio drawings

The Visual Overview functionality in DataMiner uses Microsoft Visio drawings, enriched with DataMiner functionality using special shape data fields, to provide highly customized graphical user interfaces.

At Skyline, we do our utmost to keep the DataMiner software in pace with Microsoft Visio as to features. If you notice that one of your Visio drawings is not rendered as it should be in Visual Overview, you can send us a copy of that file for diagnosis. If the problem can be tracked down to an unsupported Visio feature, we will ensure that the feature is supported as soon as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> - DataMiner supports Visio drawings saved in either VDX or VSDX format.
> - If you are using Microsoft Visio 2010, in order to open VSDX files, install either Visio 2010 SP2 or Visio Compatibility Pack. See also: [Could not load Visio file](../../part_6/ErrorMessages/Could_not_load_Visio_file.md).
> - In the drawings, you can insert images in a variety of formats: png, jpg, bmp, and emf.
> - Cropped images in Visio drawings are only supported from DataMiner 9.6.5 onwards. In prior versions, the complete image will be displayed in DataMiner.
> - If a Visio drawing contains multiple pages, in DataMiner Cube these can be displayed as separated pages in a tree view or in tabs, or both.
