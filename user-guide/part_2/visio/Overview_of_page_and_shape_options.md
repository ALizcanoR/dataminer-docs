## Overview of page and shape options

Using a shape data field of type **Options**, you can configure a number of page and shape options.

- Used on page level, it allows you to configure specific page settings.

- Used on shape level, it allows you to configure specific shape settings.

- If you specify several options, separate them by means of pipe characters (“\|”).

> [!NOTE]
> For most shape data, it is possible to specify a different separator using the \[sep:XY\] option. See [About using separator characters](Linking_a_shape_to_a_SET_command.md#about-using-separator-characters).

The **Options** shape data field can have the following values:

Blinking conditions specified on the shape itself are not affected. If, for example, you specified a show/hide condition in a shape linked to an element, you can also add the *NoAlarmColorFill* option to that shape to prevent interference of default alarm blinking with the show/hide functionality.<br> This option can also be specified on subshapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In the *NoAutoScale* mode, the zoom factor of the Visio drawing will be set to 100 percent and scrollbars will appear when the size of the card is smaller than the size of the Visio drawing.<br> It is good practice to use this option in Visio pages that contain controls (parameter controls, *SetVar* controls, charts, etc.). That way, you can prevent any scaling issues involving those controls.<br> Note that if this option is added on a page where shapes are positioned dynamically, the page canvas will automatically be expanded so that all dynamically positioned shapes are visible, with an extra margin of 10 pixels. To avoid this default behavior, specify the *ClipToBound* option.

From DataMiner 9.0.1 onwards, this option can also be used on a page, so that it is applied to all shapes on that page.<br> Note the following:<br> -  In case of grouped shapes, this property should only be specified on the main shape, except if you use dynamic placeholders in the subshapes (e.g. \[param:...\], \[property:...\], etc.).<br> -  From DataMiner 9.0.2 onwards, this option can also be applied system-wide. See [Activating the NonElementProtocol option system-wide](../../part_3/DataminerAgents/Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes.md#activating-the-nonelementprotocol-option-system-wide).<br> -  From DataMiner 9.0.3 onwards, this option can be used with a “*=True*” or “*=False*” suffix, so that it can be easily enabled or disabled.<br> -  A shape-level *NonElementProtocol* option will override a page-level *NonElementProtocol* option, and a page-level *NonElementProtocol* option will override the system-level *NonElementProtocol* option in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file. |
