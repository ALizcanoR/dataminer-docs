# Alarms

Your DataMiner System continuously retrieves a wide variety of parameter values from all elements. When a parameter is monitored, each time a value is retrieved from an element, that value is compared to a user-defined threshold. Each time that threshold is violated, the DataMiner System will generate an alarm.

Most of the alarm functionality is available via the Alarm Console.

Information on DataMiner alarm functionality is divided over the following sections:

- [About alarms](About_alarms.md)

- [Working with alarms in DataMiner Cube](Working_with_alarms_in_DataMiner_Cube.md)

- [Advanced alarm functionality](Advanced_alarm_functionality.md)
