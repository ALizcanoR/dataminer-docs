# Viewing protocol help

For many protocols in DataMiner, a help section is included with more information. This help section can for instance contain more information on the device the protocol is meant for, the various versions of the protocol, and the information that will be displayed on the element card.

There are several ways to access protocol help:

- From an element card:

    - Click the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the card and select *Help*, or

    - Go to the *Help* page in the card navigation pane (available from DataMiner 9.5.0 CU3/9.5.7 onwards).

- From the Protocols & Templates module:

    1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

    2. Right-click the protocol in question in the *Protocols* list.

    3. In the right-click menu, select *Help*.

> [!NOTE]
> If the *Help* option or page is unavailable, there is no help topic yet for the protocol in question.
