## Deleting an information template

If you are absolutely sure that an information template is no longer being used in your DataMiner System, you can choose to delete it.

1. Go to *Apps* >* Protocols & Templates*.

2. Under *Protocols*, select the protocol.

3. Under *Information Templates*, right-click the information template you want to delete and select *Delete*.

4. In the confirmation box, click *Yes* to proceed or click *No* to cancel.

> [!NOTE]
> A protocol’s default information template is defined in the protocol itself. Therefore, it cannot be deleted in the way described above.
