# Chat collaboration

In DataMiner Cube, it is possible to exchange chat messages with other users of your DataMiner System. The way this is done is slightly different from DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards compared to earlier DataMiner versions.

- [Chat collaboration prior to DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2](Chat_collaboration_prior_to_DataMiner_10_0_0_10_0_2.md#chat-collaboration-prior-to-dataminer-10001002)

> [!NOTE]
> All chat messages exchanged by DataMiner users are logged as information events. This means that they can be used to trigger e.g. Correlation rules.
