# Manipulating trend graphs

Whether you access a trend graph from a card or do so from the *Trending* module, the user interface consists of:

- A main graph area with a preview graph underneath. This preview graph represents the entire trend period (week, month, etc.). The main graph is an enlargement of the white part of the preview graph.

- A parameter pane at the bottom. This pane displays more information about the parameter for which trending is shown. If the mouse pointer is held over a point of the trend graph, detailed information on this point will be displayed in the parameter pane.

- A trend groups pane on the left-hand side.

You can change the way data are represented in the main graph area by directly manipulating the trend graph, or via the right-click menu:

- [Panning across a trend graph](Panning_across_a_trend_graph.md)

- [Zooming in/out on a trend graph](Zooming_in_out_on_a_trend_graph.md#zooming-inout-on-a-trend-graph)

- [Using the right-click menu](Using_the_right-click_menu.md#using-the-right-click-menu)

> [!NOTE]
> - If exceptions occur, these are displayed below the trend graph, while in the graph itself gaps will be displayed.
> - Gaps are also displayed for zero values or negative values in trend graphs using a logarithmic scale.
> - Some display settings for trend graphs can be changed in the Cube user settings. See [User settings](../../part_1/GettingStarted/User_settings.md).
