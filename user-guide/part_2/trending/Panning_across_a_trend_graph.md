## Panning across a trend graph

You can pan across a graph in several ways:

- On the main trend graph, drag while keeping the right mouse button clicked.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the user settings, this default behavior can be modified, so that, for example, the left mouse button can be used to pan instead. See [Trending settings](../../part_1/GettingStarted/User_settings.md#trending-settings).

- On the main trend graph, use the left and right arrow keys to move to the left or the right respectively.

- In the preview pane, drag the white section to the left or to the right.
