# Viewing trend information in a histogram

Trend information can generally also be viewed in a histogram instead of in a trend graph. This is both possible when you access parameter trend information by drilling down on a parameter on a card, and on the *HISTOGRAM* page of a view card:

- [Viewing trend information in a histogram by drilling down on a parameter](Viewing_trend_information_in_a_histogram_by_drilling_down_on_a_parameter.md)

- [Viewing trend information in a histogram on a view card](Viewing_trend_information_in_a_histogram_on_a_view_card.md)

In a histogram:

- The X-axis represents the parameter value, shown in intervals.

- The Y-axis represents the number of times the parameter value occurred in the given time span.

The histogram right-click menu allows you to:

- Change the type of Y-axis from the default setting of absolute values (the number of occurrences) to relative values (% of total occurrences), by deselecting *Use absolute frequency*.

- Print the histogram.

- Save the histogram as an image.

- Copy the histogram as an image to the clipboard.

- Export the histogram to a CSV file.
