# Displaying trend graphs

In DataMiner Cube, for any parameter that is being trended, you can display trend information in a trend graph. You can access the trend information from cards, or from the *Trending* module.

- [Displaying alarm template colors in trend graphs](Displaying_alarm_template_colors_in_trend_graphs.md)

- [Accessing trend information from the Trending module](Accessing_trend_information_from_the_Trending_module.md)

- [Working with trend predictions](Working_with_trend_predictions.md)

- [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection.md)

- [Working with pattern matching](Working_with_pattern_matching.md)

> [!NOTE]
> -  For more information on how to make sure a parameter is being trended, see [Trend templates](../protocols/Trend_templates.md).
> -  Trend graphs are automatically updated with new trend data, so leaving a trend graph open for a longer time always shows the trending up to the current time.
> -  To ensure optimal performance, we advise you not to open more than 10 trend graphs simultaneously.
