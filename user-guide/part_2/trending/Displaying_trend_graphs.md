# Displaying trend graphs

In DataMiner Cube, for any parameter that is being trended, you can display trend information in a trend graph. You can access the trend information from cards, or from the *Trending* module.

In this section:

- [Accessing trend information from a card](xref:Accessing_trend_information_from_a_card)

- [Displaying alarm template colors in trend graphs](xref:Displaying_alarm_template_colors_in_trend_graphs)

- [Accessing trend information from the Trending module](xref:Accessing_trend_information_from_the_Trending_module)

- [Working with trend predictions](xref:Working_with_trend_predictions)

- [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection)

- [Working with pattern matching](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching)

> [!NOTE]
> - For more information on how to make sure a parameter is being trended, see [Trend templates](xref:Trend_templates).
> - Trend graphs are automatically updated with new trend data, so leaving a trend graph open for a longer time always shows the trending up to the current time.
> - To ensure optimal performance, we advise you not to open more than 10 trend graphs simultaneously.
