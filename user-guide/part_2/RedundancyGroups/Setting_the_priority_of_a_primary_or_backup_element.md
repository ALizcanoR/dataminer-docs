# Setting the priority of a primary or backup element

1. Right-click the element in the Surveyor and select *Multiple set.*

2. In the *Multiple set* window, do the following.

    1. In the *Parameter* box, select the general parameter *\[Priority Level\]*.

    2. Next to *Value*, specify the new priority.

    3. On the right, select the element(s) to which you wish to apply this priority.

    4. Click *Set*.

> [!NOTE]
> -  Element priority ranges from 1 (highest priority) to 1000 (lowest priority). If priority is set to 0, this means that no priority has been set yet.
> -  Alternatively, the element priority can also be set on the *General parameters* page of each element.
