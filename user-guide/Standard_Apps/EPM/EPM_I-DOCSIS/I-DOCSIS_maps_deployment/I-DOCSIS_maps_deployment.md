# EPM I-DOCSIS maps deployment

In order to deploy the I-DOCSIS EPM maps to a DataMiner system, two different procedures are available. The choice between the two depends on the number of elements running the [Skyline EPM Platform DOCSIS driver](https://catalog.dataminer.services/result/driver/7209):

1. If the DataMiner system only contains one element running the above driver, refer to [Systems with one Backend element](xref:I-DOCSIS_maps_deployment_one_backend);
1. If it contains multiple elements, refer to [Systems with multiple Backend elements](xref:I-DOCSIS_maps_deployment_multiple_backends).
