# SRM logging

In many situations, access to logging is essential to understand a particular situation. This is even more important for bookings, where any failure (e.g. configuration not succeeded) can have an impact on live operations.

![SRM logging example](~/user-guide/images/SRM_logging.png)

Two types of log files can be generated per booking:

- Debug: Used by Skyline to investigate issues reported by end users.
- Action: Contains details about actions done by users or by Automation (during orchestration).

To view the logging for a booking, select the booking in the list or on the timeline in the Booking Manager app, and click the *Debug Log* or *Action Log* button in the lower right corner of the UI.
