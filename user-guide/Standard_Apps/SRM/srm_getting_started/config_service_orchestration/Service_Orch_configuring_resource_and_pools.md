# Configuring resources and resource pools

When you create resource pools as detailed in [Configuring pools of resources](xref:Configuring_pools_of_resources), make sure to configure the pool names as follows:

- Each pool name must consist of two string separated by a period, the first string being the virtual platform name, and the second the function name.

- For example: *SatelliteDownlink.Demodulating*.
