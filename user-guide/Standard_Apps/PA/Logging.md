# Logging

When the Booking Manager is configured to store log files in a shared folder, Process Automation will generate one log file per main token pushed into a process.

More information on the Booking Manager [here](xref:Booking_Manager_user_interface).

Note that the default name of the Booking Manager element used by Process Automation is *Process Automation Instances*.
