> [!NOTE]
> Files marked as “synchronized” in the rightmost column are synchronized among all DMAs in the cluster every day at midnight (00:00). Therefore, it is of great importance that the time settings of all DMAs in the cluster are synchronized as well. For more information, see [How do I synchronize time settings within a DMS?](../../part_6/faq/General_configuration.md#how-do-i-synchronize-time-settings-within-a-dms)
