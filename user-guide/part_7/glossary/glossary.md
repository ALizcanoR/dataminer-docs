| Contributing service                | In DataMiner SRM, a contributing service is a service that is used by another "main" service. There is no limit to the number of contributing services a service can use. There is also no limit to the number of services that can use one and the same contributing service. The booking schedule of a contributing service can automatically follow the main service schedule (i.e. life cycle locked), or it can function independently (i.e. life cycle unlocked).

| Feature Release                     | The Feature Release of DataMiner is the upgrade track of the DataMiner software introducing new features on a regular basis. This upgrade track is fully supported in a production environment, but typically only used when a specific new feature is needed. This upgrade track has time-limited support for cumulative updates, as it is required to follow the track of the consecutive upgrades in order to get all the improvements. In other words, following this fast track implies following those upgrades in order to have an updated system.                 |

| Service profile                     | Profile for one or more service definitions that makes it possible to preconfigure profile instances for the service definitions, so that these no longer need to be selected during booking creation. In DataMiner, this is available in the form of service profile definitions with corresponding service profile instances. See [Using the profiles tab](../../part_4/SRM/The_Services_module.md#using-the-profiles-tab).                                                                                                                                             |

| Service protocol                    | Protocol that can be assigned to a service when the service is created or edited. Such a service is known as an “enhanced service” and allows alarm monitoring and trending. <br> Note that in earlier DataMiner versions the term “service definition” was used instead, but this term is now exclusively used for the definition of how the various functions in a service are linked to each other, in the context of DataMiner SRM.                                                                                                                                   |
| Service state                       | In the context of DataMiner SRM, this is the state that is defined for each phase in the life cycle of the service representing a booking, e.g. start, stop, pause, standby, etc. When there is a change in the life cycle of the booking, the resources used in the booking will be configured according the settings for the corresponding service state. See [Service and Resource Management](../../part_4/SRM/SRM.md#service-and-resource-management).                                                                                                               |
