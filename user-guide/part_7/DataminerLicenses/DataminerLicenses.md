# Obtaining a DataMiner license

There are four procedures to obtain a DataMiner license:

- [License for DMA to be installed by Skyline](License_for_DMA_to_be_installed_by_Skyline.md)

- [Full license for DMA to be installed by user](Full_license_for_DMA_to_be_installed_by_user.md)

- [Online demo license for DMA to be installed by user](Online_demo_license_for_DMA_to_be_installed_by_user.md)

- [Offline demo license for DMA to be installed by user](Offline_demo_license_for_DMA_to_be_installed_by_user.md)

> [!NOTE]
> -  Only customers who have received a written agreement from the Skyline Sales Department can request a DataMiner license.
> -  When a DataMiner license is about to expire, a pop-up message is displayed that contains the email address to be used for all communication regarding license issues. By default, this message is displayed in Cube if less than 24 days are left before the license expires.
> -  In DataMiner Cube, you can find the license information by clicking the question mark in the header bar, and then selecting the *license* tab in the *About* window. Under *Licensed options* you can find the list of DataMiner applications for which you have a license. Under *Used license counters* you can see the number of items in use compared to the total number of items allowed by the license.
