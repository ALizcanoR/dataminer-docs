# Offline demo license for DMA to be installed by user

In case of a time-restricted demo license for a DataMiner Agent that will not have a permanent connection to the Skyline licensing server, the following procedure applies:

1. Wait until you receive a DMA ID from Skyline.

2. Install the DataMiner software.

3. Start the DataMiner Agent.

    At this point, startup will fail.

4. Provide Skyline with a copy of the file *request.lic*, located in the folder *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\*.

5. Wait until you receive a file called *response.lic* from Skyline.

6. Copy the file *response.lic* to the folder *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\*.

7. Start the DataMiner Agent.
