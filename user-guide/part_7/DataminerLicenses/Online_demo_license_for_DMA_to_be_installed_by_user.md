# Online demo license for DMA to be installed by user

In case of a demo license for a DataMiner Agent that will have a permanent connection to the Skyline licensing server, the following procedure applies:

1. Provide Skyline with the server name.

2. Wait until you receive a DMA ID from Skyline.

3. Install the DataMiner software.

4. Start the DataMiner Agent, which will make an unsuccessful attempt to register with the Skyline licensing server.

5. Contact Skyline to request a license activation. Skyline will then activate the online demo license for the server in question.

6. Restart the DataMiner Agent. From this point onwards, it will register successfully with the licensing server.

> [!NOTE]
> At all times, the DataMiner Agent has to be able to connect to the following URL:
