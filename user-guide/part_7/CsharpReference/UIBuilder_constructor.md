## UIBuilder constructor

```txt
UIBuilder()
```

Initializes a new instance of the *UIBuilder* class.

For example, to declare a new dialog box, use a statement like the following one:

```txt
UIBuilder uibDialogBox1 = new UIBuilder();
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use Intellisense, the name of the dialog box has to start with “uib”.
