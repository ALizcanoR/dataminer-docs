## UIResults constructor

```txt
UIResults()
```

Initializes a new instance of the UIResults class.

To use this class, first declare a *UIResults* object and then make sure the dialog box passes all captured information to that object.

See the following example:

```txt
UIResults uir = null;
uir = engine.ShowUI(uibDialogBox1);
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use IntelliSense, the name of a *UIResults* object has to start with “uir”.
