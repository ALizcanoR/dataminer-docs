# Configuring the TCP-IP socket settings

If you want a DataMiner Agent to forward information to third-party applications via TCP/IP sockets, you have to configure the socket settings in the *DataMiner.xml* file, which is located in the DMAâ€™s *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\* directory.

The following sections contain more information on this configuration:

- [Configuring the necessary tags in DataMiner.xml](xref:Configuring_the_necessary_tags_in_DataMiner_xml#configuring-the-necessary-tags-in-dataminerxml)

- [Testing alarm forwarding](xref:Testing_alarm_forwarding)

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.0.11 onwards, if an AlarmSocket or PollSocket is used, the forwarded data will be encoded as UTF-8, while previously it was encoded using the ANSI code page of the DMA. The data sent to the PollSocket must also be encoded using UTF-8.
