> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 9.0.5 onwards, the Disk Space Watcher functionality monitors the predicted available space on the C: drive. The *SLDBConnection.txt* log file mentions how much space is still available on the disk, and when the disk is expected to run out of space.
>
> The predicted time when the disk will be full is also included in the reports generated by the SLWatchdog process.
