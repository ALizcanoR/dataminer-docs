# DMS Maintenance and Support

In addition to the limited warranty, you can enjoy the benefits of the **DMS Maintenance & Support service**, which provides:

- **unlimited technical support** during CET business hours (assuming that your staff has successfully completed the standard DataMiner training program), and
- all **DataMiner software upgrades** (minor and major) at no additional charge.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about our regular business hours, see [Technical support escalations and SLAs](xref:Overview_Support_Escalations_SLAs).

DMS Maintenance & Support is supplied at **no charge commencing the date of delivery and continuing for a period of 6 months**.

After this initial period, the DMS Maintenance & Support Service **can be purchased on an annual basis**, at a percentage of the cost of the deployed software licenses (assuming remote access is available for tech support services). Optionally, this service can be upgraded to 24/7 technical support.

Updates and upgrades are available for both:

- the common standard off-the-shelf software platform, and
- the connectors purchased from Skyline, which are deployed to interface with specific third-party products.

New updates and upgrades of the software are delivered at Skyline’s sole determination and decision, subject to availability, and where necessary aligned with the agreed support priorities. They are based on the technology innovations that take into account the general interests of all software users, the overall roadmap of the software, and Skyline’s business.
