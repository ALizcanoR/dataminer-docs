In addition to the limited warranty, you can enjoy the benefits of the **Support Services**, which provides:

> For more information about our regular business hours, see [Technical support escalations and SLAs](xref:Overview_Support_Escalations_SLAs).

DataMiner Support Services is supplied at **no charge commencing the date of delivery and continuing for a period of 6 months**.

After this initial period, Support Service **can be purchased on an annual basis**. Optionally, this service can be extended with Outside of business hours support for priority level-1 issues.

Updates and upgrades are available for both:

- the common standard off-the-shelf DataMiner software platform, and
- the connectors purchased from Skyline, which are deployed to interface with specific third-party products.

New updates and upgrades of the software are delivered at Skyline’s sole determination and decision, subject to availability, and where necessary aligned with the agreed support priorities. They are based on the technology innovations that take into account the general interests of all software users, the overall roadmap of the software, and Skyline’s business.
