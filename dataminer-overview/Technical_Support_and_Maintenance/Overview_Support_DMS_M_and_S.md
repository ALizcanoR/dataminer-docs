# DMS Maintenance and Support

In addition to the limited warranty, the customer can enjoy the benefits of the DMS Maintenance & Support service, which provides (1) unlimited technical support during CET business hours (assuming that the customer’s staff has successfully completed the standard DataMiner training program) and (2) all DataMiner software upgrades (minor and major) at no additional charge.

DMS Maintenance & Support is supplied at no charge commencing the date of delivery to the customer, and continuing for a period of 6 months. After this initial period, the DMS Maintenance & Support Service can be purchased on an annual base, at a percentage of the cost of the deployed software licenses (assuming remote access is available for tech support services). Optionally, this service can be upgraded for 24/7 technical support.

Updates and upgrades are available for both (a) the common standard off-the-shelf software platform as well as for (b) the software drivers purchased from Skyline which are deployed to interface the standard software platform with specific third-party products.

New updates and upgrades of the software are delivered to the client at Skyline’s sole determination and decision, subject to availability and where necessary aligned with the support priorities defined herein, and based on the technology innovations that take into account the general interest of all software users and the overall roadmap of the software and Skyline’s business.
