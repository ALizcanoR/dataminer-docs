# Upgrade policy and timing

Skyline Communications maintains a monthly cycle of small updates, and a yearly cycle of major updates. The objective of the monthly upgrade cycle is the introduction of minor enhancements and bug fixes, while the annual major release typically introduces ground breaking new innovations and enhancements. Every available release is announced with comprehensive release notes, containing detailed descriptions of all software modifications, which are automatically delivered to the users via the DMS Tech Flash email distribution channel. DataMiner is based on a non-exclusive upgrade model, meaning that customers can skip any of the available updates, and then only install the most recent upgrade, which automatically brings along all previous upgrades.
