# Technical support escalations and SLAs

Skyline’s Maintenance & Support includes telephone and email support, online documentation, and a web-based portal for submitting and tracking of cases of failures and/or malfunctioning in the software encountered by the client.

A fault that needs corrective action can be reported through Skyline’s **DataMiner Integrated Operations Center (IOC)**. If you report a fault in the software by means of a telephone call, you must confirm the call within 2 hours by sending an email to Skyline’s IOC.

A fault is determined as a non-conformity with respect to the user documentation or training material and/or a failure with respect to the functionalities of the solution and/or a deviation from the normal functioning of the operational system. A fault can for example be a software bug.

Support is available during **regular business hours**, i.e. **9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday, CET** (Central European Time), excluding Skyline’s pre-scheduled and official public holidays.

Support priorities are assigned by Skyline based on the impact of the problem on your environment:

- **Level 1**: The fault continuously or intermittently influences the normal behavior of the software in a way that makes it entirely useless, and no alternatives are available.
- **Level 2**: The fault affects the software or a part of the software, but it does not render it entirely useless (possibly because of workarounds or fallback mechanisms).
- **Level 3**: The fault does not really affect the current use of the software but could possibly affect the software at a later time or could potentially escalate to level 2. This level is also applicable for all faults that cannot be classified as level 2 or level 1.

Based on these priority levels, support is provided as follows:

| Priority Level | Availability | Targeted Response Time | Targeted Workaround Time | Targeted Fix Time |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | Regular Business Hours | 1 business hour | 8 business hours | 5 business days |
| Level 2 | Regular Business Hours | 8 business hours | 16 business hours | 30 business days |
| Level 3 |Regular Business Hours | 24 business hours | 48 business hours | 90 business days |

- **Response time** means the time required by Skyline to provide a notification of proper receipt and follow-up to the client.
- **Workaround time** means the time required by Skyline to put in place a temporary remedy to eliminate the fault. A workaround solution may cause minor restrictions in the software or the system’s performance or availability. A successful workaround will deescalate the fault to the subsequent lower-priority level, and its prolonged targeted fix time will then be applicable, with as a minimum the level-3 timing.
- **Fix time** means the time required by Skyline to prevent the reoccurrence of the fault and remedy its underlying causes. When a fix is implemented, the system is restored to full functionality and performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Workaround and fix times will start counting as soon as Skyline is able to reproduce the fault.

## Around-the-clock (24/7) Support (optional)

Our optional "around-the-clock (24/7) support" includes support over the phone 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. If you opt for this 24/7 technical support, you will have access to a **dedicated 24/7 hotline**. Outside regular business hours, you can contact this hotline for support.

Minimizing the impact of the fault on the software and on your system will be the main priority of Skyline's 24/7 support. If a fault is reported to the 24/7 hotline, we will register the fault and provide a workaround or fix if possible. As soon as regular business hours begin, we will follow up on the fault in depth.

| Priority Level | Availability | Targeted Response Time | Targeted Workaround Time | Targeted Fix Time |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 24/7 Support | 24 hours per day, 7 days a week | 30 minutes | 2 hours | According to its priority level, and starting from regular business hours |

> [!NOTE]
> 24/7 support outside regular business hours is available for priority level 1 faults only. It is limited to registration of the fault by Skyline and, where possible, a workaround or fix.
