# Out of business hours support
Last-minute and planned work may require interventions outside business hours. When subscribing to Support Services a user has the option to extend the service to outside business hours support or request the service ad-hoc, to foresee for these interventions.
By last-minute work it's meant Level 1 Priority issues **impacting** the system, the corrective work done for those focuses in minimizing the impact of the issue on the software and on your system.

> [!NOTE]
> Out of business hours support is available for Level 1 Priority Issues and planned intervention work.

## Out of Business Hours subscription
When a user subscribes to this service Skyline will produce a detailed document describing the system implemented to equip the team working outside of business hours with the necessary information to best assist the user in case of planned or last-minute interventions.

The user has then access to a **dedicated 24/7 hotline** and can get support over the phone 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.
- **guaranteed service** for last-minute interventions 
- reduced [service fee](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/) for **planned interventions**

## ad-hoc out of business hours services
There's no additional subscription cost, but the service fees for the on-demand use of these services. 

Planned interventions are also available without an active **Out of Business Hours subscription**. However, it's not possible to guarantee Response or Corrective time for last-minute interventions.
