# Technical Support Escalations and SLAs

Skyline’s Maintenance & Support includes telephone and email support, online documentation, and a web-based portal for submitting and tracking of cases of failures and/or malfunctioning (a “Fault”) in the software encountered by the client (“Support”).

A fault that needs a corrective action can be reported through Skyline’s DataMiner Integrated Operations Center (IOC).

A fault shall be determined as non-conformity with respect to the user documentation or training material and/or a failure with respect to the functionalities of the solution and/or a deviation to the normal functioning of the operational system. A fault can for example be a software bug.

Support is available during business hours, which is 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday, CET (Central European Time), excluding Skyline’s pre-scheduled and official public holidays (“Regular Business Hours”).  If a fault in the software is reported by means of a telephone call, the client shall confirm the call within 2 hours by sending an email to Skyline’s IOC.

Support priorities are assigned by Skyline based on the impact of the problem on client’s environment:

- **Level 1**: a condition where the fault continuously and/or intermittently influences the normal behavior of the software in a way that it becomes entirely useless for client, and no alternatives are available.
- **Level 2**: a condition where the fault affects the software, or a part of the software, but where it does not render it entirely useless for client (possibly by means of workarounds or fall back mechanisms).
- **Level 3**: a condition where the fault does not really impact on the use for client, but which possibly could affect the software at a later time, or which potentially could escalate to level 2. Level 3 will also be applicable for all faults that cannot be classified as level 2 or level 1.

| Priority Level | Availability | Targeted Response Time | Targeted Workaround Time | Targeted Fix Time |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | Regular Business Hours | 1 business hour | 8 business hours | 5 business days |
| Level 2 | Regular Business Hours | 8 business hours | 16 business hours | 30 business days |
| Level 3 |Regular Business Hours | 24 business hours | 48 business hours | 90 business days |

**Response time** means the time required by Skyline to provide a notification of proper receipt and follow-up to the client.

**Workaround time** means the time required by Skyline to put in place a temporary remedy to eliminate the fault. A workaround solution may cause minor restrictions in the software or system’s performance or availability. A successful workaround will deescalate the fault to the subsequent lower-priority level, and its prolonged targeted fix time will then be applicable, with as a minimum the level 3 timings.

**Fix time** means the time required by Skyline to prevent the reoccurrence of the fault and any underlying causes of it. When a fix is implemented, the system is restored to full functionality and performance.

Workaround and fix times will start counting as soon as Skyline is able to reproduce the fault.

## Around-the-clock (24/7) Support (optional)

The optional “around-the-clock (24/7) support” includes support over the phone 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  For this purpose, the client will have access to a dedicated 24/7 hotline, which will be activated in between Regular Business Hours (“24/7 Support”).

The aforementioned 24/7 Support is, due to its nature, available for priority level 1 faults only, and limited to a registration of the fault by Skyline, and where possible, a workaround or fix.

Minimizing the impact of the fault on the software and the client’s system will be the main priority of Skyline under 24/7 Support. A fault reported during 24/7 Support, will be followed up with full in-depth support as soon as the next regular business hours period starts.

| Priority Level | Availability | Targeted Response Time | Targeted Workaround Time | Targeted Fix Time |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 24/7 Support | 24 hours per day, 7 days a week | 30 minutes | 2 hours | According to its priority level; and starting from next Regular Business Hours |
