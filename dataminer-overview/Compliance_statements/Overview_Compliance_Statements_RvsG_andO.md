# Requirements vs Goals & Objectives

As with any software and ICT integration project in general, it is impossible for anybody to provide an exact specification of what is needed and expected in relation to all workflows, all UIs, all different target user groups in the organization, and much more.  

Moreover, each individual business or operation, including yours, has its own very specific individual needs, as these are impacted by many things including but not limited to for example the way the operation is organized, the architecture of the underlying operational systems, the specific products used from various vendors, the features supported by the APIs on involved third party products, the performance and behavior of involved third party products, the impact of existing habits of how things have always been done in an organization or by teams, the business strategy and priorities, commercial business models and much more.  And again, this applies to any such type of project, irrespective of technology selected or industry segment.  It is simply the nature of these type of transformation projects.

Therefore, each project starts typically with specific goals and objectives that an organization has, which are then translated into a first set of requirements by the internal users, collected throughout the organization.  The latter can be limited or quite elaborate.

But nevertheless, the fact of the matter will always be that because of the nature of software ICT projects, those requirements will never be fully accurate, nor will they ever be conclusive – the good news is they don’t have to be and shouldn’t be; due to the complexity of a software ICT ecosystem, and the general challenge for users to express their exact desires and needs accurately, a lot of (often very implicit) assumptions are made during the drafting of requirements.

Typically, important requirements and expectations will always still be missing, and other requirements that have been stipulated will turn out to be less relevant as to what was envisioned initially.  Equally, some activities will turn out to be more complex to achieve (e.g. due to unexpected limitations of an underlying API), while others might turn out to be more reasonable than expected.

Furthermore, even for just one single requirement, software and ICT technology offers limitless options in terms of a practical implementation.  And again, there might be different opinions on which options are the most suitable, depending again on many factors such as personal preferences, existing habits and practices, and much more.  This while of course the time and resources available for the implementation of the solution are finite.

**Bottom line, priorities shift and requirements evolve throughout the lifecycle of a software delivery project due to several reasons ; change should be embraced to guarantee you get the best possible solution and are not constraint to what was foreseen several months before.**

Ultimately it is the actual implementation, and how it was done, that will define the value of the project.  And therefore, during the execution of a project like this, it is vital to keep focus on the original goals and objectives, to use the requirements as a guidance, but in the first place to look at generating value for the business, and to deliver that value as early as possible, if needed in stages.  Or in other words, to ensure that the finite time and resources are used as efficiently as possible to live up as much as possible to the objectives set forth initially.
