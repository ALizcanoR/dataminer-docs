# Tender Compliancy (licenses / engineering days)

Skyline answers the requirements of a tender in the following way:

**"COMPLY": means that the requirement can be fulfilled with the DataMiner platform**, i.e. a combination of software licenses but more over also a certain volume of engineering days to configure the platform to your operational and business needs will be required.

Note that all the engineering days pertain to configuration of the open platform capabilities of DataMiner, and hence this represents activities that can be done by Skyline but also any other qualified third party, and your company itself.  Our recommendation for this project is to use the Skyline Deploy Squad services (referenced by the engineering days) for the initial deployment, in line with the requirements and expectations agreed upon, together with your team as your lead Devops Engineer(s) acquire knowledge and expertise, in order to take ownership and independently support any further future evolutions.  Of course, you can also always work together with Skyline for any such further evolutions.

It is important to understand that with a platform like DataMiner it is less about developing new features that impacts the core software, the majority of the requirements can be rolled out based on configuration of the platform, such as designing a tailored workflow or a use-case-specific automation script or even a user-definable API.  After all, DataMiner is designed as an enabling platform, and hence it offers unprecedented potential for anybody (because of the open architecture) to meet virtually any operational and business needs.  One could compare it with an SAP or SalesForce type of platform for that matter, of course tailored to data collection, processing, control and orchestration of ICT media ecosystems, offering sophisticated resource management and orchestration capabilities, off the shelf solutions for control panels, a vast collection of connectors for media ICT products, just to name a few. 

**"COMPLY" does not necessarily mean that the deployment of the feature or functionality is already included in our offering.**

A typical DataMiner solution consists of a mix of **standard DataMiner platform software licenses** (e.g. a certain number of connectors, DataMiner nodes (DMAs), or licenses for a certain amount of concurrent active events) on one hand, and multiple **buckets of engineering days** that Skyline Communications has foreseen to configure and set-up the DataMiner platform to your company's specific operational and business needs.

In case the deployment is not included, this will be pointed out. In such case either the software license, the engineering services or both can be offered optionally. This is often because with the information that is available in the tender, it is impossible for any Software Vendor to offer and budget the required engineering efforts in an accurate manner. Further clarifications with your company/team will be required in those cases to ensure full alignment on the expectations.

The nature of such kind of software & ICT integration project needs to deal with the fact that not all requirements are known at the time, assumptions need to be made and new requirements and expectations will very likely also arise during the project implementation phase.

The total amount of software licenses and engineering days quoted is a realistic approach to deliver a solution that fulfills your company's goals and objectives for this project within the specified time frame.

Skyline Communications aims to deliver the best possible project within the budget and the time frame. As a consequence, the total amount of engineering days Skyline Communications will spend on a particular project is capped, but then again, they can be leveraged in an agile manner (i.e. priorities can shift over the course of the execution of the project). Together with your company, Skyline Communications will set up a partnership to use the engineering days in the best possible way.

For each feature, functionality, or requirement there is typically a situation that a delivered solution can vary between an acceptable minimum viable solution up to a solution that fulfills the user’s wildest dreams and ambitions. The budget Skyline Communications typically foresees is set in a way to meet in the “golden middle”.

Certainly, your company/team has the freedom to set and shift priorities (and therefore engineering time) between buckets in the Preliminary Solution Backlog as long as the total amount of engineering days does not exceed the budget. 

As an example, your company/team can put a strong focus on the user experience and user interfaces which might require more engineering days than foreseen by Skyline Communications. That additional time budget will then be deducted from another bucket, which could be a backend automation workflow to be less complex than foreseen by Skyline Communications.
