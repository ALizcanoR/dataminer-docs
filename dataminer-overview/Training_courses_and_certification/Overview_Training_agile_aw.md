# Agile Awareness Training

While Agile plays a very crucial role in many aspects of any business, and while it might be a reasonably simple concept to explain, it is in fact a major undertaking to make it a reality.  It is a very multi-facetted and diverse process that you need to go through, and in fact also a journey without a final destination.  

It is about everybody adopting to a new mindset, about tools and technologies, about methodologies and best practices, about new values and principles, about new structures, about ways of organizing ourselves, and so much more. It truly touches upon everything that we all are very much accustomed to.  And as most of us know very well, organizations and people by nature do resist to change.  Change and letting go of old habits takes time, and therefore it unavoidably requires dedication and continuous attention.  Agile is not about one training, one lecture or speech and a booklet with some guidelines.  This is about long-term transformation and being dedicated to flourish in the new data-driven future.
