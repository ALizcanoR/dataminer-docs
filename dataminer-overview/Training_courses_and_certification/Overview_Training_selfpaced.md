# Free Self-Paced DataMiner Training

We believe in empowering people, because maximum agility can only be achieved when people are empowered with the tools to evolve continuously. Thatâ€™s exactly why DataMiner is the key asset for so many organizations.

Therefore, all official Skyline training materials (*) are available in the DataMiner Dojo Learning section, free of charge:
https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses
Below some examples of the training modules you will find on DataMiner Dojo:

(*) Note that as we add new training modules whenever new features get released, some features discussed in the training modules may rely on a more recent version of DataMiner than the one you are currently using.
