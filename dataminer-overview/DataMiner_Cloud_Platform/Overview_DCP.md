## Devops

*Empowering every single user to unleash their imagination and use all the functions available.*

### Community

DataMiner features the largest global open community of ICT experts across various market verticals by far, representing a wealth of expertise and knowledge that your DataMiner DevOps Professionals can tap into and derive value from. The community covers all aspects of DataMiner and plays a crucial role in DataMiner development, but it also goes much further than this and really immerses your teams in the overall new world mindset.

The Skyline team and the broader DevOps community are always available to assist with any questions or concerns you may have.

### Catalog

The Catalog serves as a central location to access and manage all your DataMiner artifacts, including connectors, with the ability to easily download and upload. The upcoming iteration of the Catalog will include a wider range of artifacts, such as Visio diagrams *(coming soon)*, Automation scripts *(coming soon)*, and DMAPP packages *(coming soon)*!

### DataMiner Integration Studio (DIS)

The **DataMiner Integration Studio (DIS)**, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in the form of a **plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio**, streamlines the process of **building, designing, validating, and deploying** connectors, Automation scripts, virtual functions, and more. Its **user-friendly features** make the task of developing and testing DataMiner interface connectors effortless, leading to an optimized operation.

Moreover, the IDE's integration with online code repository services like GitHub empowers everyone to become a true DevOps engineer. This integration enables developers and customers to collaborate and share their expertise, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable development process.

> - [DIS User Guide](xref:DIS)

### CI/CD

The **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** is there to automate the process of building and testing code, with a focus on utilizing tools such as DIS, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins Pipeline, and others.

The goal is to **test, configure, and build** the code in various environments, including the lab, staging, and production environment.

This process includes using **Git for push and pull requests** and utilizing a CI/CD pipeline to **automatically trigger and execute multiple steps**, such as building the solution, executing unit tests, performing code analysis, running the DIS validator, publishing a new version of the connector, and deploying Automation scripts from a GitHub repository.

**Continuous deployment** involves creating a DCP key, adding it as a secret in the repository, and adding the Skyline DataMiner Deploy Action to your workflow to streamline the deployment process.

## Platform Services

*Less overhead and higher availability, thanks to “as-a-service” options.*

### Health

The **Health package** is an insurance policy for your system that includes features like automated log file collection in order to act quicker and the upcoming **SPI (System Performance Indicators) collection** *(coming soon)* for proactive support. Thanks to automated log file collection, we can provide faster support without requiring a user action. The upcoming SPI collection, currently under development, aims to enhance visibility by providing superior coverage through a steady flow of data, which ensures that even proactive support can be offered. This means that potential incidents will be identified early on, allowing for prompt discovery and resolution before they impact the user.

### ChatOps

**ChatOps** is a feature that enhances the value of **Teams** as you collaborate more effectively using insights and controls from your DataMiner System with generic or custom chat commands. It is especially useful for teams that need to communicate and interact with one another frequently. In the future, we plan to offer support for ChatOps on **Slack** as well, as it is a widely used team messaging platform.
