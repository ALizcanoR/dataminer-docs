# Upgrade policy and timing

## Supported versions
Skyline Communications supports up to 3 major versions at any time, being the current Main Release and the 2 previous Main Releases. For instance, if the current latest DataMiner version is 10.0.x, the version 9.6.x and 9.5.x will still be supported via an active DataMiner Maintenance and Support Contract.

## Upgrade cycle
Skyline Communications maintains a monthly cycle of small updates and a yearly cycle of major updates.

- The objective of the **monthly upgrade cycle** is the introduction of minor enhancements and bug fixes.
- The **annual major release** typically introduces ground-breaking new innovations and enhancements.

Every available release is announced with comprehensive release notes, containing detailed descriptions of all software modifications.

DataMiner is based on a non-exclusive upgrade model, meaning that users can skip any of the available updates and then only install the most recent upgrade, which automatically brings along all previous upgrades.

> [!NOTE]
> In case you skip multiple major releases, you will need to install each Main Release version sequentially to upgrade to the latest version. See [Upgrading your DataMiner System](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/upgrading-your-dataminer-system/).

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on the DataMiner release cycles, see [DataMiner Main Release vs. Feature Release](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-main-release-vs-feature-release/).
