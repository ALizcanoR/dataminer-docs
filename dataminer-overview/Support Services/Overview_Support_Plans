# Support Plans

## About
DataMiner Support Plans are technical support services for the DataMiner core platform, connectors and cloud services. Three support plans are available, providing different levels of support depending on the user's needs and goals. 
- [Community](#Community)
- [Continuity](#Continuity)
- [Evolve](@Evolve)

In addition to Continuity or Evolve, a user can subscribe to the Out-of-business-hours support add-on ([OBH support](https://docs.dataminer.services/dataminer-overview/Support%20Services/Overview_Out_Of_Business_Hours_Support.html)).


### Community
The Community plan enables access to Skyline's Operations team through the forum ([questions](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) section) and unlimited access to technical resources such as the learning materials, tutorials or code examples. [Proactive support services](https://docs.dataminer.services/dataminer-overview/Support%20Services/CCA_Support_Services.html) are included in this plan. 
While software updates to the DataMiner core software are included, connector updates and access to remote technical support (i.e. Operations team) are charged per hour. 
This plan is primarily intended for DataMiner platform users who have free or pay-per-use systems or entry-level subscriptions. 


### Continuity
The Continuity plan provides unlimited technical remote support during business hours, software updates and upgrades for the core software and connectors, proactive support services and guaranteed response and corrective action times.
It's the standard support plan for Users with perpetual use licenses and subscriptions starting from a minimum Monthly Utilization Allowance ([Minimum MUA](https://docs.dataminer.services/dataminer-overview/Pricing/Pricing_Commercial_Models.html#subscription-plan-vs-pay-per-use-plan)).


### Evolve
The Evolve plan goes beyond standard support adds improved response and corrective times and offers a more personalized support as well as strategic guidance from our experts, including: 
- dedicated appointed support contact 
- access to Direct Message channel (available on Microsoft Teams)
- dedicated customer success team, with a yearly allocated time budget to support and consult your team
- Quarterly Executive Reviews

Evolve Plan goes beyond a premium support, it's a partnership between the user and Skyline to leverage DataMiner to its full potential, adopting an agile mindset to support your continuous evolution.
Because the foundation is mutual commitment, the Evolve Plan cannot be sold as a separate commercial product. To upgrade from Continuity to Evolve an Organization must have a [DataMiner DevOps](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-devops-professional-program/) team in place and accumulate [DevOps Points](https://docs.dataminer.services/dataminer-overview/DevOps/DataMiner_Devops_Professionals/Benefits_DevOps_Professional_Program.html#accumulating-devops-points), which attest to that team's engagement and effort.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Evolve Plan Minimum Requirement: **50,000 DevOps Points** across all DataMiner DevOps in the Organization in a calendar Year

> [!NOTE]
> The number of DevOps points measured at the end of the calendar year is the number used in the next support renewal to determine the Support Plan - Continuity or Evolve.
