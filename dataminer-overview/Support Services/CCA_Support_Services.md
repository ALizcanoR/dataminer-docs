# CCA Support Services

By [connecting your DataMiner Agents to the cloud](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud), you can take full advantage of all dataminer.services functionalities and the powerful technical support capabilities offered by the Operations team at Skyline.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about all available dataminer.services functionalities, see [dataminer.services](xref:Overview_DCP).

These technical support capabilities include the following:

- The ability for us to automatically take **crash dumps and logging directly from your DataMiner Agents**, kick-starting the incident support process

- **Remote DataMiner Cube access by our Operations team** to see the problems you encounter first-hand and take direct action if requested

- These abilities can lead to **faster SLA response times** and give our teams **better information** to make strong interventions and fixes

- If your agents are cloud connected, then you’re automatically enabled for our [CDMR system](xref:CDMR) (Customer DataMiner Reporting) which sends daily updates of your system status to us, enabling **proactive support by monitoring the health of your operation**. Also, for existing agents reporting to CDMR, you’ll no longer need the mail connection to send the system health information to us

We are continuing to evolve these remote support features to turn our Operations team into your ultimate DataMiner co-pilot, where you can have peace of mind to get on with running your operation, and let us take care of the rest.

All this comes at no extra cost for users with a [Perpetual-Use License](xref:Pricing_Perpetual_Use_Licensing). For DataMiner Systems running on the new [usage-based services](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service), this is already the default operational mode.
