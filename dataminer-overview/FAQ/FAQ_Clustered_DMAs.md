# What are the benefits of using clustered DMAs as opposed to separate DataMiner Systems?

Non-clustered systems are like having one system, or two or more separate systems. When you cluster several DataMiner Agents and form one DataMiner system, there are several benefits. Amongst others:

- Every piece of functionality can be listed at once. For example: one system allows you to have a dashboard with data combined from multiple systems.
- Capacity can be combined and utilized efficiently across the clustered DataMiner system.
- The DataMiner drivers of individual DMAs are combined and available across all DMAs of the cluster, allowing more efficient use of these drivers.
- Offers end-to-end view of services to improve service monitoring.
- End-to-end Correlation Engine and Automation Engine functionality, i.e. cross system Automation and Correlation.
- Having one report with data from both areas.
- Correlation rules based on alarms from both areas.
- One-time set-up of your filters for your email notifications (e.g. when user wants to receive an email for each critical alarm).
- Admin work (e.g. setting up for automated backups) only to be performed once.
- Unified alarm templates and several admin level settings.
- Cross system Advanced Analytics, e.g. cross system behavior analysis.
- Unified SMS gateway integration/messaging integration.
- Single cluster integration to ticketing platforms.
- Unified user and group permissions.
