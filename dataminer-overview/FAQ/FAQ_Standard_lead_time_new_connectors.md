# What is the standard lead time for new connectors?

DataMiner is guaranteed to integrate with any data source (device, system, software application,…) from any vendor independent of the protocol required, including both industry standard protocols such as SNMP as well as full proprietary / vendor specific protocols. Today more than 6000 different devices and systems from more than 600 different vendors have been integrated in DataMiner. Current integrations include interfacing via physical interfaces such as Ethernet, RS232, synchronous and asynchronous RS485/RS422, GPIB, analog and digital contacts, using both standard (including but not limited to Modbus, SOAP, XML, APIs, CORBA, WMI, SQL, HTML, telnet, SSH, SNMP, REST, IS-OX etc.) and full proprietary / vendor-specific protocols. Due to the large variation in integrations (e.g. type of protocols, number of read and write parameters on a specific type of device, etc.), and various external dependencies (e.g. availability of remote monitoring and control interface documentation, availability of a test & validation device, etc.), Skyline cannot unconditionally commit on a lead time to develop and deliver a new driver.

On the average, across all integrations done in the past, the lead time for a new driver (including testing & validation) is about 6-9 weeks. But due to large variations in complexity, the lead time for individual drivers can also largely vary (e.g. a simple device can be integrated in a few hours, while a very complex and comprehensive device can take multiple months).

Please note this also depends on the timing of the purchase as well. As any company, our development capacity is finite, and the current state of our development pipeline will impact on the lead time, that’s inevitable. A timely purchase or planning will always help.
