# What are the principal advantages of DataMiner?

This section summarizes some of the main advantages of DataMiner solutions that qualitatively differentiate Skyline Communications:

STANDARD OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTION: DataMiner is a standard off-the-shelf solution, and does not include any bespoke software development.

AWARD-WINNING: DataMiner was awarded by a global independent jury of industry experts as “Best Network Management Solution of the Year”. In 2011, Skyline Communications was awarded as the Most Promising Corporation in Belgium by Ernst & Young. In 2012, the company won the prestigious “Export Lion 2012” Award. In 2013, Skyline Communications was included in the Top 50 Belgian Entrepreneurs by De Tijd, as well as in the Technology Fast50 by Deloitte in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Skyline Communications was also awarded Teleport Technology of the Year by WTA in 2016, and won its second “Export Lion” award in 2017.

VENDOR-INDEPENDENT: Skyline is a vendor-independent supplier and does not supply any other industry technology nor does it have exclusive ties with equipment vendors. This guarantees that DataMiner can easily be integrated with any product from any vendor, today as well as in the future.

PROVEN TECHNOLOGY: The standard off-the-shelf DataMiner solution has been selected and deployed by renowned corporations such as Al Jazeera, British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Eutelsat, GlobeCast, Liberty Global, Ooredoo, Portugal Telecom, Vodafone and many others. This illustrates the leading position of the solution and its flexibility to be deployed for a plethora of different network management applications.

INDUSTRY-STANDARD HARDWARE: DataMiner is a powerful software solution that runs in combination with industry-standard hardware, readily available from different vendors. By avoiding specialized hardware, operators will be able to drive down the cost of ownership (lower cost per unit because of the wide availability, lower cost for spare or replacement parts, etc.), and they will also remain vendor-independent in terms of hardware components, today as well as in the future.

INDUSTRY-STANDARD INTERFACES: DataMiner has a pronounced open architecture, and uses industry standards such as SNMP and ASCII sockets to the maximum extent. This guarantees that DataMiner can easily be integrated with other third-party software applications to further enhance operations.

MULTI-VENDOR: DataMiner is the only true multi-vendor solution in the industry and can be integrated with any device from any vendor, irrespective if that device has a standard or proprietary interface. Today, more than 5500 different devices from more than 600 different vendors have already been integrated, and new drivers are added on a weekly basis.

OPEN DRIVER FORMAT: All drivers in a DataMiner System are designed in an open XML format. As such, anybody can create new drivers or modify existing drivers. This guarantees that the users are completely independent from Skyline Communications as technology supplier, and if necessary they can interface the platform with any new device, including proprietary devices or systems.

ACCESSIBLE: Because of its open policy for client interfacing and its powerful web-based user interface, DataMiner is one of the most accessible solutions in the industry. Operators can rest assured that the platform can be accessed from any location, at any time considered necessary.

SCALABLE: Because of its unique distributed intelligence architecture, DataMiner can be deployed in small configurations up to large corporate configurations, with no compromises in terms of performance and storage capacity. The distributed architecture also provides the ultimate flexibility and allows operators to choose between a centralized, regionalized or distributed architecture. Today, the largest DataMiner Systems literally span around the globe and manage several millions of devices.

PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT: A default DataMiner System comes with a set of features and capabilities that increase the availability and enable proactive maintenance and support. This includes an automatic and user-definable reboot procedure, generic watchdog strategy, automatic collection and email forwarding of fault and logging information, automated backup, scheduled email health reporting, self-maintaining database with user-definable settings, etc.
