# Agile Partnership

Skyline Communications aims to create an agile partnership with its users. In the first place, Agile needs to be a **mindset shared by the entire team** on how to successfully manage and execute a project.


This chapter provides a brief overview of the principles and how we deliver value together with you.
Moreover, the "Agile Scope-based methodology" is introduced, as we believe this is the preferred one above other deployment methods such as “turn-key” (waterfall) or  “agile time and materials based”.
