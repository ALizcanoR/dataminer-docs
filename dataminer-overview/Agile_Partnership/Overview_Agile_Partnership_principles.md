- Together, the customer/users and Skyline Communications create a **Project Squad** with only one clearly defined goal.

- The customer/users and Skyline Communications fully **embrace the agile partnership**, based on the general agile principles, which especially value collaboration, responding to change, working software, and individuals & interactions.

- The customer/users and Skyline Communications define **clear roles** for everybody in the Project Squad, including who decides: product owner, stakeholders, business representative.

- The customer/users and Skyline Communications **fully acknowledge the challenges** ahead and will work to mitigate those: change management, responsibility to balance time budgets, etc.

- The customer/users and Skyline Communications fully embrace the **key methodologies and principles** required to be successful: transparency, weighing value vs. effort, early demonstrators, the value of retrospect, stakeholder involvement, etc.
