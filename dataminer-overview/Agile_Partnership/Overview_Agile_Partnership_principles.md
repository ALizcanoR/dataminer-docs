- Together the customer/users and Skyline Communications create a **Project Squad** with only one clearly defined goal.
- The customer/users and Skyline Communications fully **embrace the Agile Partnership**, based on the general Agile Principles - collaboration – responding to change – working software – individuals & interactions…
- The customer/users and Skyline Communications define **clear roles** for everybody in the Project Squad, and who decides - product owner, stakeholders, business representative.
- The customer/users and Skyline Communications **fully acknowledge the challenges** that are inevitably ahead of us and will work to mitigate those - change management, our responsibility to balance the time budgets, etc.
- The customer/users and Skyline Communications embrace and are religious about the **key methodologies and principles** required to be successful - transparency, weigh value vs effort, early demonstrators, the value of retrospect, stakeholder involvement, etc.
- The customer/users and Skyline Communications leverage **tools & technology** to keep us focused on the execution - Project Collaboration, DataMiner Cloud Platform, MS365, Teams, QA Automation, Deployment automation, etc.
