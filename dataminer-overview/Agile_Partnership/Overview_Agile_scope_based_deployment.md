# Agile Scope Based Deployment

An agile partnership also needs to detail the deployment methodology, the overview below indicates the most important topics of “agile scope-based” deployment: principles, phases, and a high-level overview.

## Principles

- Fixed agreed time frame
- Fixed agreed budget
- High-level requirements, well-defined goals, and objectives
- Focus on individuals and interactions with constraints on time available
- Continuously evolving high-level documentation and maximum focus on working software
- Collaboration-driven towards an agreed, well-defined goal within a set time frame
- Working towards the goal, with the flexibility to easily respond to change, with time constraints in mind.


## Phases

- Offering
- Definition of goals & ambitions
- Setup of the solution backlog
- Sprint planning & execution 


## High-level Overview

The Agile Scope Based project methodology is most suitable for projects with well-defined goals and objectives (i.e. high-level requirements) but which at the same time also still have a lot of unknown factors, both from a user expectation as well as a technical implementation perspective (e.g. ambiguous requirements, no well-defined exact user expectations, unknown technical dependencies, etc.).  But despite that, also projects with still the ambition to put the best possible DataMiner solution in place A) within a fixed time frame and a well-defined fixed budget, and B) which will effectively but also reasonably live up to the expectations defined in those goals and high-level requirements.

This methodology is comparable to the typical agile approach of an ICT software development or ICT integration project, but with a fixed pre-defined budget and implementation time span that all parties aim to comply with.  The methodology embraces change where necessary to deal with the unknown as efficiently and continuously as possible, and hence does not rely on rigid formal Change Request procedures for example.  The Project Squad, consisting of both Skyline experts and user representatives, applies agile methodologies and mindset to the maximum extent and leverages continuous feedback from and interaction with the end-users to continuously deliver maximum value for minimum effort, in order to deliver the best possible solution by the anticipated end date of the project and within the budget allocated.
 
All involved parties also understand and acknowledge that it is impossible to expect that all possible imaginable features and capabilities that can potentially be envisioned by all individuals, directly and indirectly, involved in the project and be derived from the initial goals and high-level requirements, can effectively be delivered within the expected time frame and budget. Nevertheless, they trust that they can A) deliver maximum value within those time and budget boundaries, and B) that the solution will fully comply with the overall goals and high-level requirements defined.
