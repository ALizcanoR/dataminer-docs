# Frequently asked questions

### Usage-based services

1.	Can different commercial models exist in the same organization? 
Yes – licensing is at a DataMiner System level. An organization can have a system based on the perpetual model and another usage-based.  
2.	Can I transition my perpetual licenses into subscription? 
Yes – get in touch with your Account Manager. 
1.	Are there any sign-up, or one-time fees? 
No.  
2.	How is monthly usage of ‘data collection and control plane’ calculated? 
The sum of the maximum number of active Managed Objects (for Managed Objects with 100+ metrics) and metrics (Managed Objects under 100 metrics) at any given time. Metering follows the 95% percentile – i.e. maximum usage after skipping the peak 5% usage – in practice allowing some room (36h per month) for tests or bursts in usage. 
3.	What level of support is included with Usage-Based services? 
See DataMiner Support Services | DataMiner Docs 
4.	Is outside business hours support available?
