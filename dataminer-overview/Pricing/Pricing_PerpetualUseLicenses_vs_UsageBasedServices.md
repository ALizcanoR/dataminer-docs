# DataMiner Perpetual Use Licenses vs Usage-based services

The Perpetual Use model offers perpetual ownership over a named license through a one-time purchase with an optional recurrent cost for support services.

Usage-based services are charged based on the actual monthly usage of services, where an **Utilization Allowance** can be used freely in any combination of services which can change monthly.

|---------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| System capacity | Server-based licenses, each with fixed capacity tiers of managed objects: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 (for approved applications), 1000. | Volume-based, per managed object or monitored metric per month. Independent from the number of nodes deployed. |
| Failover | Server-based license | Included (the user can deploy additional nodes for Failover without paying additional fees since billing is based on the active number of managed objects or monitored metrics in a month) |
