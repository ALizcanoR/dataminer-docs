# Pricing

DataMiner open monitoring and orchestration software is a transformational platform offering a broad range of modular functions with an unlimited number of applications. Depending on where you find yourself on your digital transformation journey, on what your business models and strategy are, and on how you intend to use the platform, you may be looking for different commercial and delivery models. Skyline can offer you maximum choice and flexibility to perfectly align with your priorities.

DataMiner can be used with **Perpetual-Use Licenses** or with two flavors of usage-based service models, namely the **Subscription Plan** and the **Pay-per-Use Plan**.

For the usage-based models, pricing is available for both self-hosted (on-premises or in a private cloud) and Skyline-hosted (referred to as *DataMiner as a Service*) systems.

## Perpetual-Use Licenses

Perpetual-Use Licensing is based on the proven and flexible DataMiner Licensing Scheme, which has been available for several years. Licenses are available for **DataMiner nodes** (which are available in different capacity tiers to manage a set number of Managed Objects), for **optional features**, and for **connectors** that interface DataMiner with different third-party products (the latter irrespective of the total number of elements managed with the connector, and with a fixed price regardless of whether the connector exists or still needs to be developed).

Perpetual-Use Licenses are a one-off expenditure.

> [!NOTE]
> Perpetual-Use License deployments are typically further complemented by the optional [DataMiner Support Services](xref:Overview_Support_DMS_M_and_S), which provide both technical support as well as unlimited access to all available DataMiner software upgrades and updates. For Perpetual-Use Licenses, the cost for DataMiner Support Services is an annual recurring fee, relative to the value of the deployed Perpetual-Use Licenses.

### Subscription Plan

DataMiner Subscription Plan is a yearly subscription built around a flexible, simple and transparent software utilization offering whereby a **Monthly Utilization Allowance (MUA)** is available for the operational teams to leverage DataMiner and to evolve it easily and continuously as dictated by their momentary needs, in terms of scale, in terms of utilization of its wealth of modular functions, and in terms of interfacing with third-party products.

The Subscription Plan offering results in a well-defined and controlled expenditure, combined with maximum freedom for the operational teams to leverage any of the many capabilities of DataMiner without any limitation, in any way deemed of value for the operation.

### Pay-per-Use

DataMiner Pay-per-Use is the most flexible model, very similar to the Subscription Service, but with no fixed Monthly Utilization Allowance nor annual contract or commitments. DataMiner usage is simply metered on a monthly basis and deducted from the defined allowance.
