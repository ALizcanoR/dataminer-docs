### Free DataMiner System

Every company can get started with one free standalone DataMiner System, a functionally full-featured DataMiner platform, only limited by the credit allowance per service.

This is the perfect way to get started, allowing anyone to use the platform and build up knowledge on the many possibilities the platform has to offer, within this free allowance.

When ready to scale up, the user can setup a yearly subscription or start with a number of credits in the Pay-per-Use model.

## Commercial models

DataMiner is available as a usage-based service in two commercial models – **Pay-per-Use Plan** and **Subscription Plan** – providing the exact same service with different service rates and contracted differently.

A Subscription Plan presents a more predictable budget. It is more suitable for steady usage and rewards users with a more favorable credit rate for the longer-term commitment. With a Subscription Plan users subscribe to a Monthly Utilization Allowance (MUA) that stipulates the maximum number of credits that can be used in a month.

In case of a Pay-per-Use plan, user pay for what they use, giving ultimate flexibility and allowing for varying usage patterns (e.g. ad-hoc usage spikes during special events).

|         | Subscription Plan | Pay-per-Use |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Monthly utilization and metering | The user subscribes to a **fixed number of credits** per month (Monthly Utilization Allowance - MUA) that can be used towards any combination of services throughout the month within the contracted MUA. | The user sets an Allowance that can be freely used in any combination of services. Usage is metered on a monthly basis and deducted from the Allowance, allowing for **variable usage** patterns. |
| Roll-over credits | Unused credits do not roll to the next month. | Unused credits expire 12 months from Start Date. |
| Minimum contract duration | 12 months | - |
| Automatic renewal | X | - |
| Annual subscription fee | X | - |
| Over utilization | Charged at a premium fee | - |
| Support services | X (Support tier depends on the MUA level) | community |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system must have Cloud services enabled in order to enable metering for systems that are hosted by the user (on-premises or private cloud). The system will stop working if disconnected for longer than 24 hours.

### Subscription Terms & Conditions

After the Anniversary Date it’s invoiced yearly, unless replaced by a new contract.  
Credit rate 	The price of a credit is protected for the contract duration, i.e. 24- or 36-months subscriptions avoid the potential yearly price adjustments 
 
Cancellation 	Subscriptions can be cancelled up-to 30-days before the Anniversary Date. The subscription will remain active until the Anniversary Date. The amount paid is not refundable. 
 
Changes to the subscribed MUA Level 	MUA can be increased at any time, at the then current credit rate, without changing the Anniversary Date. Lowering MUA is only possible at the Anniversary Date. 
 
Metering 	Metering works in monthly cycles, starting at the first of each month. MUA is pro-rated for the first and last months. E.g.  
MUA – 200 credits 
Start Date – October 20, 2022 
Anniversary Date – October 19, 2023 
MUA available for the period October 20, 2022 to October 31, 2022 = 200 credits x  12 days / 31 days = 77.4 credits 
MUA available for the period October 1, 2023 to October 19, 2023 =  200 credits x 19 days / 31 days = 122.6 credits 
 
Over utilization 	Consumption above the contracted Monthly Utilization Allowance (MUA) is possible, with the additional consumed credits being invoiced monthly, at the then current Pay-per-Use credit rate.
