# Agility – The cornerstone of any successful data-drive media operation

While mankind is transitioning from one era into an entirely new one, the media and broadband industry too is going through some very existential transformations.

But how do you keep up with these transformations?

While people are very much focused on technology, it’s important to understand that it is about a lot more than just that. Digital Transformation is just as much about people and methodologies, and how you leverage technology.

In short, you need to be Agile: it’s the cornerstone of any successful data-driven media operation.
