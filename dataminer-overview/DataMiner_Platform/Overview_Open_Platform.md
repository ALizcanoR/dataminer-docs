- **End-to-end Network Management System**: DataMiner enables end-to-end integration of even the most complex technical ecosystems.

- **Orchestration and Automation**: Unlock all possible potential using transparent end-to-end, cross-vendor, and cross-technology automation, including profile management and service & resource management.

- **AI and Augmented Operation**: Big data strategy, store-everything architecture, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, self-learning software, etc. provide unprecedented proactive insight into your operation. The AI is built into the core of DataMiner and enables real-time and offline analytics.

- **Data Acquisition and Control Plane**: Integration with operational processes (OSS). Consolidate all data across all data sources, and build your data-driven operation on a rock-solid, standardized foundation.
