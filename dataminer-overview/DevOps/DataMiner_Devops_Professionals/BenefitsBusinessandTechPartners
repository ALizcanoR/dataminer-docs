# Benefits for DataMiner Business & Technology Partners

By creating DataMiner business value and market presence, you earn DevOps Points. Not only do these points determine your [DevOps Professional level](#accumulating-devops-points), they also allow you to enjoy the plentiful benefits attached to the DevOps Professional Program.

> [!NOTE]
> We are continuously working on further evolving this key program, so new benefits or ways of collecting DevOps Points can be expected.

As a DataMiner Business Partner or DataMiner Technology Partner, by default you are eligible to all general DevOps Points [General](#Benefits_DevOps_Professionals_Program).
In addition to these general DevOps Points, as a partner you gain from engaging in business activities. 
Activities result in DevOps points which can be accumulated and transferred to either personal or professional benefits (i.e. earning professional service credits [DataMiner Dojo](#https://community.dataminer.services/professional-service-credits/)

As a business & technology partner you can accumulate DataMiner DevOps points through:

- **Scheduling an in-person meeting with Skyline Professionals during an exhibition/show**: When you officially schedule a meeting at our booth upfront of the show and the meeting effectively happened then
you will receive 500 DevOps points per meeting.  (e.g. the days before IBC you've scheduled 5 meetings with 2 attending people at our booth, after the show if these 5 meetings went through then a business or 
technology partner you will receive (500 DevOps points/meeting x 5)/2 = each of you will collect 1.250 DevOps points.)

- **Schedule a virtual meeting meeting with Skyline representatives and a customer:  When you initiate and schedule a virtual meeting with us and a customer, after the meeting you'll receive 
100 DevOps points (divided by the number of attendees in the meeting)

- **Host/Co-Host a DataMiner Inspire or Empower 'on tour' event:  Up to 1.000 DevOps points/day (divided by the selected number of people)

- **Submitting a use case: You can choose to submit a use case for the community, and upon acceptance, this will result in 250 up to 1000 points. Use cases could focus on a new product integration that you have completed for DataMiner, or on any other type of solution that you have implemented with DataMiner.

- **Enrolling in and completing online DataMiner sales & business related training courses: The DataMiner Community offers a selection of free online training around Digital Transformation, Agile Deployment of projects, DataMiner business models, etc. Enrolling in and completing any of those courses will again generate points (between 10 to 50 points). Note that the community also offers a variety of free self-tests to evaluate your knowledge. The successful completion of those quizzes will also result in points.
