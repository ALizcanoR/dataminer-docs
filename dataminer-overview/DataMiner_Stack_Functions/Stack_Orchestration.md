# Orchestration

***Maximize efficiency with powerful automation and orchestration***

![stack.functions.categories](~/dataminer-overview/images/stack_orchestration.png)

**DataMiner Service and Resource Management (SRM)** empowers ICT media & broadband teams with a versatile toolset tailored to their orchestration and automation needs. We all know there are no one-size-fits-all automation and orchestration solutions, so with DataMiner, DevOps engineers can cherry-pick the right tool for the right job, creating value in the fastest possible manner.

DataMiner supports **four different use cases** that can flexibly be combined within or across workflows:

- [Resource Scheduling](https://community.dataminer.services/service-resource-management/#resourceScheduling): Keeping tracks of all resource schedules without automating actions, for maximum flexibility.
- [Resource Automation](https://community.dataminer.services/service-resource-management/#resourceAutomation): Intelligent resource configuration with a click of a button.
- [Resource Orchestration](https://community.dataminer.services/service-resource-management/#resourceOrchestration): The power of Resource Scheduling combined with automatic configuration actions at the start and end time of bookings.
- [Service Orchestration](https://community.dataminer.services/service-resource-management/#serviceOrchestration): Orchestration of the complete life cycle of services.

> [!TIP]
> More information on the SRM use cases is available in the DataMiner [**Service and Resource Management User Guide**](xref:About_SRM)

Each of the four above described DataMiner SRM use cases relies on a **combination** of different DataMiner modules, such as the **orchestration and automation stack functions**, elaborated below.

## Function Virtualization

Replacement of network appliance hardware with virtual machines or containers.

With DataMiner Virtual Functions, the elementary functional capabilities of a complex product are exposed as individual, elementary resources that can be monitored, configured, and used in DataMiner SRM very easily.

## Scheduler

Manage a list of scheduled tasks in an automated way.

The scheduling engine is the beating heart of DataMiner. It executes scheduled actions precisely, reliably, and on time. The engine can trigger a variety of DataMiner actions, including any and all automation script executions needed by DataMiner SRM.

## Job Manager

Plan administrative tasks, called jobs, in a fast and reliable way.

The DataMiner Job Manager can be used to create and manage jobs, which are then distributed to SRM applications, so that the necessary bookings can be generated.

## Automation Engine

Open-architecture, fully user-definable automation engine.

The DataMiner Automation engine performs all automation tasks in the ecosystem. Its pronounced open architecture enables operators to easily create scripts and customize script behavior to their specific environment whenever needed. Even if tasks are automated, the operator always remains in control.

## Apps

Out-of-the-box solutions for specific tech domains.

A typical example as part of the automation and orchestration stack, is the Booking Manager app, a standard application that allows you to create and manage bookings using DataMiner Service & Resource Management (SRM).
Other examples are the DataMiner "Infrastructure Discovery and Provisioning (IDP)" app and the DataMiner "Precision Time Protocol (PTP)" app.
