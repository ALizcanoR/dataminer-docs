## Spectral Data Processing

Processing remote sensing data from operational and historic missions in an online platform.

DataMiner Spectrum Analysis provides operators with the unique opportunity to benefit from real-time remote, multi-user RF measurements, as well as continuous 24/7 RF fault and performance management, by integrating with and processing RF data from:

**any spectrum analyzer:**

- high-end analyzers at strategic points in your operation
- mainstream commodity analyzers in high volume
- any product with spectrum monitoring measurement (e.g. cable modem, CMTS, remote PHY, etc.)

**but also:**

- legacy products
- packaged Carrier Management Systems

**and**

- RF routing/switching solutions (L-band router, return path switch, etc.)

DataMiner brings it all together in one standard graphical UI, with a rich set of features and capabilities that runs completely transparently across any analyzer you have today or at any time in the future.

## Performance Management

Ensuring that a set of activities and outputs meets an organization's goals in an effective and efficient manner.

This particular stack function keeps track of detailed historical key performance readings up to more than one year. Any parameter made available by the API of any data source, can be trended, (like interface bandwidth, utilization (Mbps, %), rate errors, collisions, CPU usage, etc.) for later evaluation of its performance, allowing for debugging and forecasting of future behavior.

DataMiner allows the user to define exactly for which parameters trending information has to be logged in the trending database, and what kind of trending information has to be included. In a trend template, you can define both the scope (which parameters) and the type (real-time data, average trending or a combination of both) of the trend information to be stored in the trending database.

In combination with a Cassandra and Elastic database, DataMinerâ€™s [Augmented Operation](xref:Stack_Augmented_Operations) is enabled, including AI features such as trend prediction, pattern matching and much more.
