## Object Modeling

Visual representation of software or system objects, attributes, actions, and relationships.

Data modeling is the process of creating logical representations of the data stored in an operation.

The **DataMiner Object Model (or DOM)** enables quick modeling and management of any type of **administrative or business-related data** in your DataMiner System, e.g. ticketing and jobs information, planned maintenance records, product catalog data, contractual and customer records, etc.

All your defined DOM instances are stored in an Elasticsearch database to ensure high performance and scalability.
