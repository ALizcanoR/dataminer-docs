# Augmented Operations

***Ensure maximum uptime by leveraging big data and AI***

![stack.functions.categories](~/dataminer-overview/images/stack_augmented_operations.png)

**Make the shift from reactive to proactive management.**

DataMiner Augmented Operation **captures, correlates and analyzes** all data sources in **real time**. It learns the relationships between metrics and generates alarms when anomalies are detected. This predictive approach improves performance and reduces system downtime.

This technology, built into the core of DataMiner, leverages state-of-the-art big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. As we are dealing with **increasingly more complex and agile ecosystems that are continuously evolving**, the way it is set up today could be very different as opposed to how it is setup the day after.

Today’s operations are more about the **behavior of metrics and resources rather than the absolute state or value**, and how they are evolving over time. A certain value which is normal right now, could be the same value one hour later, but with a completely different context, because of services that have been added, the time of the day, etc., turning it into a value which is no longer normal for the ongoing operations.

Equally, DataMiner Augmented Operation is about **reducing time for set-up & configuration, and increasing the efficiency of the management.**

It will **provide operators with unprecedented insights on the most complex operation**, and enhance the experience of the operator, by augmenting the data and make it easier to look at.

Combined with the ability to **leverage the unique e2e value proposition of DataMiner**, DataMiner Augmented Operation is simply indispensable to manage tomorrow’s operational ecosystems in a proactive manner.

The **fully integrated out-of-the-box solution** and its **self-learning technology**, increases efficiency and accuracy, drastically reduces configuration effort and cost, and helps in adopting a proactive operating strategy.

## Trend Forecast

Predictions based on data.

The AI-powered forecasting functionality automatically learns the behavior and evolution of the operational system and its performance metrics, and extends that towards the future, allowing the operator to gain more in-depth insights and manage the operation more proactively.

## Automated Tagging (aka Pattern Matching)

Automated application of tags to describe content.

Through automatic tagging functionality, behavioral patterns in the trend data, special events or behavioral changes can be easily tagged to enrich an operation with context information, and empower advanced behavioral monitoring.

Based on AI pattern matching algorithms, instances of tagged patterns are automatically recognized and labelled both in historical trend data and in the new incoming real-time data.

## Change Point Detection

Detecting abrupt shifts in time series trends.

DataMiner’s change point detection solution automatically identifies both abrupt and subtle behavioral changes in the trend data of individual performance metrics in (semi) real time. Detection of a change in level, trend or variance can be applied for early fault detection as a user can be warned about previously unseen or rare behavior. Knowledge of change points also proves useful in improving the modelling and prediction of the metric behavior, and in the automatic detection of relationships between metrics or DataMiner objects.

## Anomaly Detection

Locating unusual points or patterns in a set of data.

An anomaly significance scoring mechanism augments the change point detection solution and identifies the changes in metric behavior which are truly exceptional or unexpected taking historical metric behavior and previously detected change points into account.

## Incident Notification (aka Automatic Incident Tracking)

Reporting of certain trigger events.

The automatic incident tracking feature autonomously learns about system behavior and leverages the rich context of alarms and relational information available in a DataMiner system to automatically correlate alarms belonging to a specific incident. No manual pre-analysis, and time-consuming setup and configuration of correlation logic is required.

## Focus Alarms

Show past behaviour of alarms.

Based on an analysis of the alarm history and its patterns, the focused alarms option reduces alarm noise and allows easy focus on the events and incidents which are truly impactful.
Focus alarms only show the ‘unexpected’ alarms and ignore recurring alarms due to bad template configuration.

## Proactive Cap Detection

Detect critical highs and lows in your network before they occur.

The proactive cap detection solution provides an automated zero-configuration risk analysis for metrics to hit important key values, such as the absolute minimum or maximum value of a metric, or a user defined alarm threshold.

By continuously monitoring and modelling the trend of the metrics, proactive cap detection will give the user an early warning if it predicts problems on a metric in the future without generating many false positive alarms. This enables a proactive way of tackling emerging issues and prevents issues from impacting services.
