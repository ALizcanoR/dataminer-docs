# Your role

In line with the general trend, your own role in the overall market landscape has evolved considerably. This means you have to realign with the needs and expectations of your customers.

We no longer live in a world where an organizationâ€™s engineering team contracts a select number of vendors alongside a system integrator, to implement monolithic bespoke ecosystems which are then handed over to an operational team to be operated in a static mode for 5 years or longer.

Today, the **key objective is to build an agile, data-driven operational ecosystem that can be evolved easily and continuously**.

Furthermore, in the new world, the qualities, features, and characteristics of an operational platform are no longer exclusively defined by the actual core processing products that have been deployed, whereas this was the case with bespoke monolithic hard-coded ecosystems.

The fabric of the connectivity, the functions of the various modular components, are only definitive to some point.

Today, the quality, features, and characteristics of an operational platform are increasingly more defined by the tooling layer that wraps around it.

That layer defines how the infrastructure is used, what types of workflows are supported, how efficiently the core processing products can be used, how secure the platform is, how easily new emerging products can be leveraged, and much more.

And of course, DataMiner strongly focuses on that tooling layer that wraps around the core processing products and delivers on that.

##### So what can you offer the new market?

- **General consultancy & guidance**:

  The transition to transformational technology is impacting anything imaginable related to an operation and organization, e.g. the way systems are architected, deployed, operated, and evolved.

  It also affects the way companies and teams are organized, how they need to collaborate with you and other actors (such as technology and product vendors), and how services are delivered, business models, and so forth.

  This is the world of Agility, DevOps, CI/CD, continuous learning, data-driven empowerment, being goal-driven rather than task-driven, collaboration, continuous innovation, and so on.

  Therefore, **customers need partners that can guide them through this, that share the new mindset, and empower their organization**.

- **System architecture consultancy & services**:

  Today, the objective is two-fold:

  - Building and designing an ecosystem to support a specific type of business or operation

  - Building and designing an ecosystem so that it is an agile, data-driven platform that can evolve easily and continuously: a solution that is driven by open architecture coding tools, code repositories, CI/CD infrastructure that enables low-effort and safe continuous evolution, powerful data collection, automation, orchestration, process automation tooling, and much more.

  The latter objective adds a new dimension to any project these days, which, in fact, is far more strategic and relevant compared to the core infrastructure.  

- **Innovation services**:

  The new generation of transformational technology can be leveraged in countless of ways. Therefore, today does not revolve around lifting and shifting an existing business to a new generation of technology, but about being innovative and taking the opportunity to rethink and question everything we are accustomed to.

  In that sense, **the qualities and capabilities of the solutions are no longer exclusively defined by the technology and products vendors**.

  Today everyone, including yourself, can be a creator and innovator and go to market with an exclusive offering. More than ever, you hold the key to success, and no longer is this solely a prerogative of product or technology vendors.

- **Implementation services**:

  Your expertise, knowledge, and imagination have become part of your key assets, and DataMiner empowers you to now also realize your plans, **turning those exclusive concepts into tangible deliverables** for your customer base.

  DataMiner enables you to imagine new types of services, new workflows, more optimal or secure ways to leverage products and technology, and much more. DataMiner hands you the tools to capitalize on your ingenuity and skills sets.

  You can go to market either with a solution offering or a professional services offering.
