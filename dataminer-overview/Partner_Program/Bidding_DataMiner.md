# Bidding DataMiner

I’m bidding DataMiner for a [Digital Transformation](xref:Overview_Platform_intro) program,  what do I need to take in account for building my winning proposal:

## Value Proposition:

- **Goals & Objectives**:  what are the general goals & objectives of the potential program/project.
- **Value Delivery Plan**: what’s the value delivery plan,  what do we know about the deployment build-up window, go into production, how the project will be deployed
- **Assumptions & Dependencies**: what are the known assumptions & dependencies related to the project, what do we have to take into account for our proposal

## Digital Transformation Program:

Beyond the DataMiner deployment, there is set of important intel that contributes to the right value proposition and eventually a winning bid:

- Are we looking to a relocation program (new office building, new infrastructure, new technology introduction)?
- Are we dealing with a merger of different departments coming together,  grouping different sets of roles, resources & technologies?
- From a business perspective, is the end user looking to Staff/Resource optimization?
- Are we facing EOL of current products that need a replacement. If yes, which ones?
- What is the impact on the current operational workflows, is the general digital transformation also a window to re-assess the workflows of tomorrow (hand in hand with the new technology)? If yes, is all necessary user intel available to embed in our value proposition proposal?
- Will the technology we are introducing be operated by different teams, cross-departmental? If yes, which teams will operate the platform and do we have a buy-in with all of them (planning, engineering, operations, billing, field forces, support teams,…)?
- In case a third-party entity will manage/operate the platform, has this entity the in-house attestations related to DataMiner DevOps Professional? If yes, which ones?
- Change Management, are there any or expected pitfalls related to adoption of new software, new workflows, people we need to know about and take into account during the offering & deploy of the program? How are we dealing with the digital transformation and the impact on the users/human aspects.

## Platform & Scaling:

- Do we have a BOQ – which vendors, which data sources (equipment, etc.) are to be integrated into DataMiner?
- Are there third-party platforms (north-bound & south-bound) we need to interface with?  If yes, which ones?
- On which platform will DataMiner be running and which party will offer the standard off-the-shelf hardware based on the [recommended hardware specs](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-compute-requirements/)
  - On-Prem physical servers
  - On-Prem running on [virtual servers/VM instances](xref:Regarding_virtual_servers)
  - User provided cloud platform
  - DataMiner SaaS – DM Azure

## Create & Deliver:

- Who’s the prime bidding party in the offer?
- What is the expected role of the prime bidding party related to:
  - Local staff availability
  - Liability towards DataMiner installation (physical installation, software installation, remote access, handling IT security, etc.)
  - Is there a local site survey required?
  - Workflow design & analysis with the end user
  - Testing workflows end to end
- Does the end-user have [DataMiner DevOps Engineers](xref:Overview_DevOps_index) at hand who are able to manage, operate and even grow the platform beyond this program or is it 100% handled by a third-party?
- In case the end user has no in-house DataMiner expertise, is it the intention to build-up the knowledge and capacity along with this digital transformation program, therefor allowing the platform to evolve continuously?
- Does the end user have an official mandate to be an active party in the design/integration/deploy, who are allowed to be part of the overall agile deploy squad team?
- Has the prime-bidding party the resources related to roles such as:
  - General Product Owner
  - An Agile Coach
  - DevOps Quality Coach
  - [DataMiner DevOps Professionals](xref:Overview_DevOps_index), and what is their current attestation level?
- Has the prime-bidding party knowledge about the Agile Deploy Manifesto and the [principles of Agile](https://community.dataminer.services/agile-dictionary/) (including but not limited to Backlog refinement, Burn Down Chart, Daily scrum,  Devops, Epics, MVP; Sprint Planning, etc.). If not as part of this program, do we need to take in account the knowledge transfer?
