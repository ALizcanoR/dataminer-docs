|&nbsp;&nbsp;Enumeration|Large-Allocation|Tells the browser that the page being loaded is going to want to perform a large allocation.|

Otherwise, a proxy MAY send a Subst response-header field, if it makes a substitution based on the information in a SubOK request header field (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mogul-http-dupsup-00).|
