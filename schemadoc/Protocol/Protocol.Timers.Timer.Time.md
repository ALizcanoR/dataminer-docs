# Time element

Specifies how frequently the included groups will be executed.

## Type

[TimerTime](xref:Protocol-TimerTime)

## Parent

[Timer](xref:Protocol.Timers.Timer)

## Attributes

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|[dataDisplay](xref:Protocol.Timers.Timer.Time-dataDisplay)|unsignedInt||Specifies the execution frequency of the included groups when a Data Display has been opened.|
|[initial](xref:Protocol.Timers.Timer.Time-initial)|string||Specifies whether the timer should be started when the element is started.|

## Remarks

Contains either

- **loop**

  The included groups will be executed over and over again.

- **value > 0**

  The included groups will be executed every X milliseconds.

  It is good practice to use the following intervals:

  - Slow interval (in case of static data): 3600000 (1 hour)
  - Medium interval: 60000 (1 minute)
  - Fast interval (for example in case of alarm info): 10000 (10 seconds)

> [!NOTE]
> Since DataMiner 9.0.0/9.0.4 (RN 14392), the maximum time a timer can be set to is 24 days (2073600000). In case a larger value is specified, the following message will be logged, â€œInvalid (too large) time-range specified for timer [x] [set value]. (Defaulting to 24 days)"), and the time will be set to 24 days instead. In earlier versions, when the timer was set to more than 72h, false positives in the timer thread were raised. When the time was set to more than about 24 days (2^31), the value wrapped around, and the timer value was 'unspecified'.

## Examples

```xml
<Time>loop</Time>
```
