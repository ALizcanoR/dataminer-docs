### Enhancements

#### SSH settings saved in parameters are now passed to SLPort together instead of separately [ID_36404]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you set up an SSH connection in a protocol, you can store the username, the password, the SSH options and the IP address in parameters using a `<Type options="">` element inside the `<Param>` element.

| Parameter          | Option                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| SSH username       | `<Type options="SSH USERNAME">` |
| SSH password       | `<Type options="SSH PWD">`      |
| SSH options        | `<Type options="SSH OPTIONS">`  |
| Dynamic IP address | `<Type options="DYNAMIC IP">`<br>Note: This value can also be used for other types of connections. |

Up to now, when an element with an SSH connection was started, these values would each be passed separately to SLPort. From now on, they will all be passed together to SLPort.

> [!NOTE]
> A separate set will be performed whenever one of the above-mentioned values is changed at runtime.
