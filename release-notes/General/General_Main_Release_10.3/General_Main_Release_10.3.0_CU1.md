### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Number of 'GetParameterMessages' requests has been optimized [ID_34936]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.1 -->

The number of *GetParameterMessages* sent by SLAnalytics in order to check whether a trended table parameter is still active has been optimized.

#### Enhanced performance when creating or editing services [ID_35366]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made with regard to the communication between SLDataMiner and SLDMS, overall performance has increased when creating or editing services, especially in heavily loaded environments.

#### Enhanced SNMP trap distribution [ID_35480]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, stopped elements will no longer be taken into account when distributing SNMP traps. When a trap has to be sent to an element on another DataMiner Agent, it will no longer be sent when that element is stopped.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the maximum group event rate was exceeded [ID_35545]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the *Maximum group event rate* was exceeded.

### Fixes

#### Memory leak in SLNet after closing a client connection that had been using a "SLDataGateway.API" subscription set [ID_35319]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a client connection that had been using a "SLDataGateway.API" subscription set was closed, in some rare cases, the subscription object memory would incorrectly not get cleaned up.

#### Problem with SLElement when stopping an EPM element [ID_35439]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1]  - FR 10.3.3 -->

When an EPM element was stopped, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Two identical behavioral anomaly alarms would incorrectly be created [ID_35511]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, two identical behavioral anomaly alarms would incorrectly be created.

#### SLAnalytics : Problem after a DVE parent element had been deleted [ID_35521]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in the SLAnalytics process after a DVE parent element had been deleted.

#### Failover: Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online [ID_35534]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a failover was triggered, in some rare cases, the Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online.

In the Alarm Console, an error would appear with the following message:

```txt
Unexpected exception while triggering failover for BaseProfileManager: Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException: Exception of type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException' was thrown.
```

#### Problem when modifying the production version of a protocol with an SNMPv3 connection [ID_35538]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you modified the production version of a protocol with multiple connections, of which one was an SNMNv3 connection, in some cases, the element could lose its SNMPv3 port settings. As a result, the SLSNMPManager process would fail to initialize the SNMPv3 communication, and the following alarm would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Error parsing SNMPv3 password for port: <port number> on element: <element name>
```

Also, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when you tried to re-enter the SNMPv3 port settings.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Alarm groups could incorrectly be created without a focus value [ID_35551]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In some cases, alarm groups could incorrectly be created without a focus value.

#### Problem with parameter update throttling when subscribing to column parameters [ID_35578]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a client subscribed on a column parameter with a filter as index (e.g. *), the messages would be throttled incorrectly.

From now on, parameter update throttling can be disabled by setting the *MessageThrottlingThreshold* option to -1 in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file.

```xml
<MaintenanceSettings>
  ...
  <SLNet>
    ...
    <MessageThrottlingThreshold>-1</MessageThrottlingThreshold>
    ...
  </SLNet>
  ...
</MaintenanceSettings>
```

#### When retrieving the protocol of a DVE parent element, its alarm filter would not get returned correctly for some of its parameters that are exported as standalone parameters [ID_35607]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a client retrieved the protocol of a DVE parent element, its alarm filter would not get returned correctly for some of its parameters that are exported as standalone parameters.

#### A number of alarm-related issues have been fixed [ID_35611]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

A number of alarm-related issues have been fixed:

- In some cases, the alarm that closed an alarm tree would incorrectly not contain the root GUID.
- If no comment was passed when an alarm was cleared, in some cases, the comment of the previous alarm would incorrectly not be added to the closing alarm.
- In some cases, an incorrect `Alarm didn't have the correct format.` error would be logged.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Problem with duplicate alarms [ID_35664]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Up to now, when the SLAnalytics process started, the entire focus data cache of the agent hosting the process was cleared and recreated, causing the automatic incident tracking feature to clear any incident associated with the alarms removed from the focus data cache. When the focus data was then regenerated later on, this could lead to a recreation of the same groups.

Also, when the SLAnalytics processes of different agents in the same cluster were restarted right before a full hour, it was possible to trigger the internal duplication of active alarms hosted on non-leader agents. This could, in turn, lead to an incorrect internal alarm state and incorrect incidents containing copies of the same alarm.

From now on, the focus data cache will no longer be cleared when SLAnalytics process starts up. Instead, only the focus data associated with the alarms that are no longer active will be removed from the cache.
