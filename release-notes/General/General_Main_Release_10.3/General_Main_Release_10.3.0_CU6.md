### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: New upgrade action added that will clean up default ListView column configuration data [ID_36475]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, all default ListView column configuration data left on the server will automatically be cleaned up if no more than one Cube client has taken a copy of that data.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Presence of Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked [ID_36745]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the presence of the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked.

### Fixes

#### SNMPv3 credentials would not get deleted when an SNMPv3 element was deleted [ID_36573]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an SNMPv3 element was deleted, its SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly not get deleted. Also, when users were deleted, their DCP credentials would not get deleted.
