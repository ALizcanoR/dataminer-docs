### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_34251]

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Ticketing app: Enhanced error handling [ID_33414]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall error handling has improved.

#### Performance improvement to update service state more quickly [ID_34165]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a performance improvement, the calculated service alarm state will now be updated more quickly in the client.

#### Enhanced performance when querying large XML files [ID_34299]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made to SLXML, overall performance has increased when querying large XML files.

#### Web apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Enhanced performance [ID_34348]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements to the buffering mechanism, overall performance has improved when executing interactive Automation scripts in web apps.

#### SLLogCollector will now also collect the prerequisite output files and all upgrade logs [ID_34352]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

The SLLogCollector tool will also collect all prerequisite output files as well as all upgrade logs.

#### Lingering connections towards a DataMiner Agent will now be forcefully killed [ID_34367]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, connections between DMAs can leak TCP connections, causing new connections towards port 8004 to fail due to port exhaustion.

Up to now, when a new connection towards port 8004 failed, the following entry was logged in the SLNet log file:

``` txt
Connection to {0} via external process succeeds while same connection via SLNet process fails since {1} ({2} times) => possible lingering TCP connections issue
```

From now on, the connection in question will also be forcefully killed.

### Fixes

#### Dashboard Gateway (legacy): Dashboards would fail to show the Maps component when the DMA had HTTPS configured [ID_33777]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When a legacy Dashboard Gateway was connected to a DataMiner Agent with HTTPS configured and port 80 blocked, dashboards would fail to show the Maps component.

#### Problem when deserializing an overridden parameter description [ID_34266]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you entered an invalid value in a numeric component, the *UIResults.GetString()* method would incorrectly not return that invalid value. Instead, it returned the last valid value that had been entered.

#### Dashboards app / Low-code apps: Creating a custom theme with a custom color palette would incorrectly cause the color palette of all built-in themes to be updated [ID_34368]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLLog when closing a log file.

#### Dashboards app: Side panel context menu and selected dashboard would overlap each other [ID_34411]
