## Changes

### Enhancements

#### More detailed logging when the certificate chain is invalid while connecting to Cassandra [ID_34822]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

More detailed information will now be added to the `SLDBConnection.txt` log file when the certificate chain is invalid while connecting to Cassandra.

Log entry syntax: `Certificate chain error: {chainStatus.Status}, details: {chainStatus.StatusInformation}`

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced accuracy when generating alarm predictions [ID_35080]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy has increased when generating alarm predictions.

#### DataMiner Object Models: DomInstanceButtonDefinitions can only reference a single action [ID_35156]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

From now on, DomInstanceButtonDefinitions can only reference a single action. If multiple actions are defined, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `InvalidButtonActionCombination` will be returned.

Also, when using the DomBehaviorDefinition inheritance system, the server-side logic will now make sure that there are no buttons or actions with identical IDs on both the parent and child definition.

- If a duplicate action is found, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `DuplicateActionDefinitionIds` will be returned.
- If a duplicate button is found, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `DuplicateButtonDefinitionIds` will be returned.

#### SLLogCollector: Custom CollectorConfig XML files will now be synchronized across the DataMiner cluster [ID_35180]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

From now on, all custom CollectorConfig XML files will be synchronized across the DataMiner cluster.

#### Cassandra Cluster: Enhanced query performance [ID_35247]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Previously, queries against Cassandra Cluster would always be executed with a page size of 1000, even when the limit defined in the query was smaller than 1000. This resulted in excess data being return. From now on, the page size will be adjusted according to the limit defined in the query if it is lower than the default page size.

This change will considerably improve overall query performance, especially when retrieving trend data.

> [!NOTE]
> This change will not enhance performance when requesting trend data for an element that has no trend data points before the requested window. In cases like this, the full two-year range of shards will be queried to try and find an initial point.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: Manually created tags will now be saved as pattern occurrences [ID_35299]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when you define a tag for pattern matching, the pattern you selected will be saved as a pattern occurrence in the Elasticsearch database and highlighted in bright orange, similar to so-called "streaming matches", which are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated.

#### SLDataGateway: Memory enhancements with regard to average trending [ID_35312]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the SLDataGateway process, a number of memory enhancements have been made with regard to the management of average trend data.

#### Maps: Markers will now move more gradual when zooming [ID_35337]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, markers will now move more gradual when zooming.

#### Alarm templates - Smart baseline calculations: NullReferenceException prevented & enhanced exception logging [ID_35348]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, a `Baseline Calculation Failed: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` error would be added to the *SLSmartBaselineManager.txt* log file. The issue causing that error has now been fixed.

Also, log entries indicating an exception thrown during baseline calculations will now include details regarding the element and parameter associated with the exception.

#### Maps: Enhanced zooming behavior [ID_35351]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when you zoom in or out, the data of the previous zoom level will stay visible until the data of the current zoom level has been loaded.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Installation of Microsoft .NET 6.0 [ID_35363]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, Microsoft .NET 6.0 will now be installed if not installed already.

#### Maps: Zoom range can now be set by means of a slider [ID_35381]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

The zoom range of a map can now be set by means of a slider.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Enhanced performance when fetching relation information [ID_35414]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when fetching relation information for the automatic incident tracking feature.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: No longer available for discrete parameters [ID_35465]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, anomaly detection will no longer be available for discrete parameters.

### Fixes

#### Cassandra Cluster: Every DMA would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS [ID_31923]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

At start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS.

From now on, at start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration will only delete the old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found locally.

#### Problem with Resource Manager when ResourceStorageType was not specified in Resource Manager settings [ID_34981]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In some cases, Resource Manager could throw a NullReferenceException when *ResourceStorageType* was not specified in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ResourceManager\Config.xml` file.

#### External authentication via SAML: Issues fixed when using Okta as identity provider [ID_35374]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Using Okta as identity provider, it would incorrectly no longer be possible to read out signed assertions. Also, when the group claim setting is enabled in the *DataMiner.xml* file, the user will now be added to the correct groups.

Up to now, in case of a claim mismatch, an exception would be thrown. From now on, an entry containing a clear message will be added to the *SLNet.txt* log file instead.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Two identical behavioral anomaly alarms would incorrectly be created [ID_35511]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, two identical behavioral anomaly alarms would incorrectly be created.

#### SLAnalytics : Problem after a DVE parent element had been deleted [ID_35521]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in the SLAnalytics process after a DVE parent element had been deleted.
