### Fixes

#### Mobile apps: Problem when trying to select an item in a drop-down box [ID_34742]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

In some cases, it would incorrectly not be possible to select an item in a drop-down box when the items were grouped or when their actual value was not identical to the value that was displayed.
