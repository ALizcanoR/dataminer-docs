### Fixes

#### Mobile apps: Problem when trying to select an item in a drop-down box [ID_34742]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

In some cases, it would incorrectly not be possible to select an item in a drop-down box when the items were grouped or when their actual value was not identical to the value that was displayed.

#### Dashboards app - Time range feed: Quick pick buttons would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34759]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a time range feed was configured to show quick pick buttons, those buttons would not be displayed in the correct order. From now on, quick pick buttons will be displayed in chronological order.
