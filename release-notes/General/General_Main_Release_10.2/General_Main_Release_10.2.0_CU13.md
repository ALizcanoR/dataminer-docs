### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when creating or editing services [ID_35366]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made with regard to the communication between SLDataMiner and SLDMS, overall performance has increased when creating or editing services, especially in heavily loaded environments.

#### Enhanced SNMP trap distribution [ID_35480]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the distribution of SNMP traps, especially to stopped elements on another DMA.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Pattern matching tags could incorrectly be defined for discrete or string parameters [ID_35368]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Pattern matching does not support discrete or string parameters. However, up to now, when viewing a trend graph that showed trend information for either a discrete or a string parameter, it would incorrectly be possible to define tags for pattern matching. From now on, this will no longer be possible.

#### Trending: Tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not possible to define tags [ID_35378] [ID_35383]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, when the pattern matching feature was not enabled in *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*, the tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not actually possible to define tags.

From now on, Cube will check whether the pattern matching feature is enabled each time you open a trend graph.

#### Problem with SLElement when stopping an EPM element [ID_35439]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When an EPM element was stopped, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement.

#### SLAnalytics : Problem after a DVE parent element had been deleted [ID_35521]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in the SLAnalytics process after a DVE parent element had been deleted.
