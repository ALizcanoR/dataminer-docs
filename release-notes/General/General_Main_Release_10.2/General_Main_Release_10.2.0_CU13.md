### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when creating or editing services [ID_35366]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made with regard to the communication between SLDataMiner and SLDMS, overall performance has increased when creating or editing services, especially in heavily loaded environments.

#### Enhanced SNMP trap distribution [ID_35480]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, stopped elements will no longer be taken into account when distributing SNMP traps. When a trap has to be sent to an element on another DataMiner Agent, it will no longer be sent when that element is stopped.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the maximum group event rate was exceeded [ID_35545]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the *Maximum group event rate* was exceeded.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Pattern matching tags could incorrectly be defined for discrete or string parameters [ID_35368]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Pattern matching does not support discrete or string parameters. However, up to now, when viewing a trend graph that showed trend information for either a discrete or a string parameter, it would incorrectly be possible to define tags for pattern matching. From now on, this will no longer be possible.

#### Trending: Tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not possible to define tags [ID_35378] [ID_35383]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, when the pattern matching feature was not enabled in *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*, the tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not actually possible to define tags.

From now on, Cube will check whether the pattern matching feature is enabled each time you open a trend graph.

#### Problem with SLElement when stopping an EPM element [ID_35439]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When an EPM element was stopped, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement.

#### SLAnalytics : Problem after a DVE parent element had been deleted [ID_35521]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in the SLAnalytics process after a DVE parent element had been deleted.

#### Failover: Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online [ID_35534]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a failover was triggered, in some rare cases, the Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online.

In the Alarm Console, an error would appear with the following message:

```txt
Unexpected exception while triggering failover for BaseProfileManager: Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException: Exception of type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException' was thrown.
```

#### Problem when modifying the production version of a protocol with an SNMPv3 connection [ID_35538]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you modified the production version of a protocol with multiple connections, of which one was an SNMNv3 connection, in some cases, the element could lose its SNMPv3 port settings. As a result, the SLSNMPManager process would fail to initialize the SNMPv3 communication, and the following alarm would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Error parsing SNMPv3 password for port: <port number> on element: <element name>
```

Also, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when you tried to re-enter the SNMPv3 port settings.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Alarm groups could incorrectly be created without a focus value [ID_35551]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In some cases, alarm groups could incorrectly be created without a focus value.

#### Problem with parameter update throttling when subscribing to column parameters [ID_35578]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a client subscribed on a column parameter with a filter as index (e.g. *), the messages would be throttled incorrectly.

From now on, parameter update throttling can be disabled by setting the *MessageThrottlingThreshold* option to -1 in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file.

```xml
<MaintenanceSettings>
  ...
  <SLNet>
    ...
    <MessageThrottlingThreshold>-1</MessageThrottlingThreshold>
    ...
  </SLNet>
  ...
</MaintenanceSettings>
```
