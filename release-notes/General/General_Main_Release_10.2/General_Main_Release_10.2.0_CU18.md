### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: New upgrade action added that will clean up default ListView column configuration data [ID_36475]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, all default ListView column configuration data left on the server will automatically be cleaned up if no more than one Cube client has taken a copy of that data.

#### Smart baselines: Information event generation at 5-minute intervals has been disabled [ID_36691]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When smart baselines were configured, by default information events would be generated every 5 minutes. This information event generation has now been disabled to avoid information event floods in e.g. EPM environments.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Presence of Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked [ID_36745]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the presence of the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked.

### Fixes

#### SNMPv3 credentials would not get deleted when an SNMPv3 element was deleted [ID_36573]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an SNMPv3 element was deleted, its SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly not get deleted. Also, when users were deleted, their DCP credentials would not get deleted.

#### DataMiner Cube: Report or dashboard would not be selected after 'Email', 'Upload to FTP' or 'Upload to shared folder' action was initialized [ID_36631]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In *Automation*, *Correlation* and *Scheduler*, you can select a report of a dashboard in an *Email*, *Upload to FTP* or *Upload to shared folder* action. When such an action was initialized, in some rare cases, the report or dashboard would not be automatically selected.

#### Dashboards app: Black boxes on top of first or last field of selection boxes on small screens [ID_36738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you reduced the screen size to the point at which the navigation pane got hidden, a black box would incorrectly appear on top of the first or last field of a selection box.

#### NT Notify type NT_ADD_VIEW could be executed with an invalid parent view ID [ID_36739]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, when an `NT_ADD_VIEW` call was executed with `parentViewID` set to a non-existing view ID, the newly added view would not be visible in the Surveyor. Hence, there was no way of correcting the situation using the UI. Cube logging would include a warning that a `parentViewID` cannot be resolved.

Validation has now been added to `NT_ADD_VIEW`. When a request enters to create a view with an invalid parent view ID, the view will not be created. Also, views with an invalid parent view ID will now be placed directly under the root view. This will allow you to drag the view to its correct location, updating its parent view ID to a valid ID in the process. An error will also be logged and the *View Recursion* BPA test will report the view in question.
