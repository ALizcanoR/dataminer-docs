### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Automatically generated shapes representing bookings can now be sorted by custom property [ID_34572]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When specifying that a shape should be created automatically for each booking in a particular set of bookings, it is now possible to have the automatically generated shapes sorted by a custom booking property.

For example, in an SRM environment, you can have a booking time range that includes pre-roll and post-roll, and timings that contain the custom properties *Start* and *End*. From now on, it is possible to have the automatically generated shapes sorted by one of those custom properties. To do so, you can specify a shape data field of type *ChildrenSort* to the group-level shape and set its value to `Property|<CustomProperty>,<asc/desc>`.

Examples:

```txt
ChildrenSort="Property|Start,asc"
ChildrenSort="Property|End,desc"
```

#### SLLogCollector now also collects DxM version info and APIGateway app settings [ID_34701]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include:

- Version information of all DataMiner Extension Modules (DxM).
- The appsettings.json file of the APIGateway service.

#### Elasticsearch: Sending a GetInfoMessage of type 'IndexingConfiguration' with an invalid DataMiner ID will now only return the Elasticsearch configuration of the local DMA [ID_34774]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22]/10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a *GetInfoMessage* of type "IndexingConfiguration" was sent containing an invalid DataMiner ID, up to now, the Elasticsearch configuration of all DMAs would be returned.

From now on, when the DataMiner ID in a *GetInfoMessage* request of type "IndexingConfiguration" is invalid, only the Elasticsearch configuration of the local DMA will be returned instead.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Enhanced method to delete locked files [ID_34779]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When, during a DataMiner upgrade, an attempt was made to delete files that were locked by certain processes, up to now, that attempt would fail, causing those files to remain on the system until the next upgrade.

From now on, when an attempt to delete a file during a DataMiner upgrade fails, the extension of that file will be replaced by `.SLReplace` and, later on in the upgrade process, the file will then be deleted by SLHelper.

#### Size of log entries in log files generated by SLLog will now be limited [ID_34801]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

In log files generated by SLLog, the size of the entries will now be limited:

- Messages will be trimmed to 5120 characters.
- Methods will be trimmed to 200 characters.
- Program names will be trimmed to 200 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> Method data typically also includes the process and thread IDs.

#### DataMiner Cube: Stream Viewer enhancements [ID_34837] [ID_34838]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

The Stream Viewer tree view now supports more levels. This will allow you to display more detailed information.

For example, in case of HTTP communication, there will now be extra levels for sessions, connections, requests/responses, parameters*, and even status codes and error codes.

**only in case of a response*

### Fixes

#### 'One or more of the following modules are not licensed' error would incorrectly not list the unlicensed modules [ID_34407]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.2.11 -->

When a required software license cannot be found, a `One or more of the following modules are not licensed: ...` message will appear.

In some cases, instead of listing the unlicensed modules, this message would incorrectly only mention "None".

#### Web apps: Problem with email address boxes [ID_34421]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you entered an address in an email address box and then selected something else on the page without pressing *ENTER* or *TAB*, the email address box would incorrectly expand and show a list of suggestions.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Tooltip of an element in a service chain would incorrectly not show values of node properties [ID_34664]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When, in a service chain within a service context, an element shape was linked to a node property via a shape data field of type *Tooltip*, then the tooltip of that shape would incorrectly not show the value of that node property when using either a `[Service definition properties]` or a `[Service definition property:<property name>]` placeholder.

#### Dashboards app - Time range feed: Quick pick buttons would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34759]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a time range feed was configured to show quick pick buttons, those buttons would not be displayed in the correct order. From now on, quick pick buttons will be displayed in chronological order.

#### Standalone parameters belonging to another child of the same DVE parent element could be set to 'Not Initialized' when a row linked to a DVE child element was deleted [ID_34785]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a row linked to a DVE child element was deleted, in some cases, standalone parameters belonging to another child of the same DVE parent element could be set to "Not Initialized".

#### GQI: Filter operations would not be forwarded to the correct query when multiple data sources were joined [ID_34819]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When multiple data sources were joined, in some cases, filter operations would not be forwarded to the correct query.

#### Known Elasticsearch errors would incorrectly get logged in the SLSearch.txt log file [ID_34827]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

Up to now, when custom data was requested by ID from an Elasticsearch database, a "404" error would be logged in the *SLSearch.txt* log file when the ID did not exist.

From now on, only unknown Elasticsearch errors will be logged in the *SLSearch.txt* log file. Known errors will be logged as level-5 errors in the debug logs.

#### Memory leak in SLDataGateway during a Cassandra Cluster migration [ID_34829]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

During a Cassandra Cluster migration, SLDataGateway would leak memory due to paging handlers not being cleaned up correctly.

#### Dashboards app & low-code apps: Contents of colored table cells would incorrectly not be visible when conditional coloring was applied and actions had been configured [ID_34842]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When conditional coloring was applied on the first column of a table in which actions had been configured, in some cases, the contents of the colored cells would incorrectly not be visible.

#### DataMiner upgrade: 'Webpages\\App' and 'Webpages\\Automation' folders would incorrectly not be cleaned up [ID_34844]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

After a DataMiner upgrade, files belonging to previous app versions would incorrectly not be removed from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\App` and `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\Automation` folders. From now on, those folders will be deleted before new versions of those apps are installed.
