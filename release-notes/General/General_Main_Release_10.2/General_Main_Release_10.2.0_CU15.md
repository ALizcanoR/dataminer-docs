### Enhancements

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - GQI components: Open sessions would not be closed when a new query was triggered [ID_35824]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a GQI component still had a session open when a new query was triggered, in some cases, the open session would incorrectly not be closed.
