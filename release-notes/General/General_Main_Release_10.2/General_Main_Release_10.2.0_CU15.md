### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added to this release yet.*

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - GQI components: Open sessions would not be closed when a new query was triggered [ID_35824]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a GQI component still had a session open when a new query was triggered, in some cases, the open session would incorrectly not be closed.

#### State of the parent element would not be checked correctly when a function resource was created or updated [ID_35963]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you created or updated a function resource while its parent element was in an error state, up to now, the state of that parent element would not be checked correctly. As a result, adding or updating the function resource would incorrectly be allowed.

From now on, the state of the parent element will be checked by means of an `ElementStateEventMessage` instead of an `ElementInfoEventMessage`.
