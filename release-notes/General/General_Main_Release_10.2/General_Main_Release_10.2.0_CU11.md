### Fixes

#### Alarm state changes could be generated at an incorrect time in the trend graph of a monitored parameter that needed to be compared to a relative baseline value [ID_34952]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU11] - Feature Release Version 10.3.1 -->

In the trend graph of a monitored parameter that needed to be compared to a relative baseline value, in some cases, alarm state changes could be generated at an incorrect time.

> [!NOTE]
> When both the baseline and the factor are stored in parameters, then the baseline parameter, the factor parameter and the monitored parameter must all have the history set option enabled. Also, all history sets should be executed chronologically.
