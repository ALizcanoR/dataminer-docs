### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added yet.*

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube: Latest script updates would not be shown when opening a script in the Automation app [ID_34738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you opened the *Automation* app in DataMiner Cube and selected an unmodified script, the latest updates made to that script by another Cube client or another program (e.g. DataMiner Integration Studio) would not be shown. From now on, when you open a script in the Automation app that has not yet been changed in that same app, the latest version of that script will now automatically be retrieved from the server.

#### Problem with Elasticsearch health monitoring [ID_34744]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When an Elasticsearch cluster used by DataMiner was hosted on servers that host IPv6 addresses, the Elasticsearch health monitoring in DataMiner would fail to assess the Elasticsearch cluster state and conclude that the indexing database was unavailable.

#### DataMiner Cube - Protocols & Templates: Function protocols would incorrectly be listed multiple times [ID_34885]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you opened the *Protocol & Templates* module, in some rare cases, function protocols would incorrectly be listed multiple times in the protocol list.

#### DataMiner Cube: Renaming your local DataMiner user would incorrectly cause that user to disappear [ID_34918]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you renamed your local DataMiner user with administrative access while being logged in as that user, the user would incorrectly get (partially) removed.

#### Alarm state changes could be generated at an incorrect time in the trend graph of a monitored parameter that needed to be compared to a relative baseline value [ID_34952]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.1 -->

In the trend graph of a monitored parameter that needed to be compared to a relative baseline value, in some cases, alarm state changes could be generated at an incorrect time.

> [!NOTE]
> When both the baseline and the factor are stored in parameters, then the baseline parameter, the factor parameter and the monitored parameter must all have the history set option enabled. Also, all history sets should be executed chronologically.

#### Web apps - Visual Overview: Certain actions would no longer work [ID_35012]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

In some cases, *Card*, *Script*, *Link* and *Popup* actions would no longer work in visual overviews opened in web apps.
