### Fixes

#### Problem with SLLog when logging large entries regarding failed Elasticsearch query requests/responses [ID_35037]

#### SLDataGateway would leak memory when offloading average trend data for DVE elements [ID_35167]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

The SLDataGateway process would leak memory when offloading average trend data for DVE elements.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Multiple values in property columns would incorrectly not be separated by any separator [ID_35239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

If, in the Alarm Console, property columns are added for service or view properties, and an alarm affects more than one service or view, this can result in property columns containing multiple property values.

In the *PropertyConfiguration.xml* file, for each relevant property you can configure a *contentSeparator* tag. The separator specified in that tag will then be used to separate the values of that property.

Up to now, when a *contentSeparator* tag was left empty, the values of the property in question would incorrect not be separated by any separator. From now on, when that tag is empty, the values of the property in question will by default be separated by commas.

#### SLDataGateway could end up with an excessive number of HealthMonitor.Refresh threads [ID_35286]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, the SLDataGateway process could end up with an excessive number of *HealthMonitor.Refresh* threads.

#### Dashboards app / Low-Code Apps - Node edge component: Edge overrides would incorrectly no longer be applied [ID_35298]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, in the settings of a node edge graph, you had configured edge overrides, these would incorrectly no longer be applied.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem after filtering bookings using a custom time range in ListView component or Resource Manager component [ID_35328]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When, in a ListView component or a Resource Manager component showing a bookings timeline, you had filtered the bookings using a custom time range, performance issues could start to occur after a period of time.
