### Enhancements

#### Cassandra: gc_grace_seconds will now be set to 1 day by default and to 4 hours for records with TTL set [ID_34763]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In Cassandra databases, the table property `gc_grace_seconds` will now be set to 1 day by default.

For tables containing data with TTL set, this property will be set to 4 hours.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: No visual replacement will be displayed anymore when a State component feeds empty query rows [ID_36460]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

Up to now, when a *State* component fed empty query rows, a visual replacement would be displayed. From now on, this will no longer be the case.

#### DataMiner Agents joining a cluster will now synchronize their ProtocolScripts\DllImport folder [ID_36494]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When a DataMiner Agent joins a cluster, it will now synchronize its `ProtocolScripts\DllImport` folder.

Also, when processing a protocol, a DataMiner Agent will now synchronize

- the files in the `ProtocolScripts/DllImport` folder, and
- the files in the folders mentioned in the *QAction@dllImport* attribute.

#### Stream Viewer will now display parameter IDs in decimal format instead of octal format [ID_36525]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Stream Viewer will display an error message when an SNMP poll group contained either an invalid parameter or a parameter that did not have its SNMP setting enabled.

Up to now, that error message would contain the ID of the parameter in octal format. From now on, it will contain the ID of the parameter in decimal format instead.

#### Cassandra Cleaner will no longer try to delete non-existing folders [ID_36550]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, the *Cassandra Cleaner* tool would log an exception each time it had tried to delete a non-existing folder. From now on, when it has to delete a folder, it will first check whether that folder exists. If not, it will not try to delete it.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem with element or view scope of Children shapes [ID_36354]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

In some cases, when a placeholder was used in the *Element* or *View* shape data field of a *Children* shape, the scope would not be updated when changes were made to the placeholder.

From now on, the scope will be updated correctly whenever changes are made to the placeholder in the *Element* or *View* shape data field.
