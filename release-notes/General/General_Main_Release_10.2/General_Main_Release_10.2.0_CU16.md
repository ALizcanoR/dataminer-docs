### Enhancements

#### Failover: Obsolete CheckVIPs thread has been removed [ID_36253]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In Failover setups using virtual IP addresses, once every minute the CheckVIPs thread would check whether the online Agent holds the correct IP addresses. However, due to the many locks it claimed to verify the current state of the IP addresses, it would delay other actions being executed in the system.

This obsolete thread has now been removed.

### Fixes

#### Cassandra Cluster: Every DMA would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS [ID_31923]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.3 -->

At start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS.

From now on, at start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration will only delete the old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found locally.

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources app: Problem when opening the element list in the 'device' tab [ID_36239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you created a resource and then opened the element list in the *device* tab in order to link a device to that newly created resource, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive, especially when the element list contained a large number of elements.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: State component would incorrectly not be cleared when its input feed was cleared [ID_36261]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In some cases, a *State* component would incorrectly not be cleared when its input feed was cleared.

#### Low-Code Apps: Table actions would incorrectly be executed before the rows were fed [ID_36263]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In some cases, table actions would be executed before the rows were fed. As a result, the feed would get lost when you navigated away from the page via an action. From now on, a row will always be fed before row actions are executed.

#### Dashboards app: Height of 'DATA USED IN DASHBOARD' section would incorrectly change after collapsing and expanding it [ID_36282]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you collapsed and expanded the *DATA USED IN DASHBOARD* section of the *DATA* tab, in some cases, the height of that section would incorrectly change.

#### Monitoring app: Surveyor items would be sorted incorrectly [ID_36303]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In the Surveyor of the Monitoring app, items of which the name contained a number would be sorted incorrectly. For example, *Element 2* would appear below *Element 11*. From now on, the items in the Surveyor of the Monitoring app will be sorted in the same way as those in the Surveyor of DataMiner Cube.
