### Enhancements

*No enhancements yet*

### Fixes

#### Cassandra Cluster: Every DMA would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS [ID_31923]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.3 -->

At start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration would incorrectly try to delete any possible old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found in the entire DMS.

From now on, at start-up, every DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra Cluster configuration will only delete the old Cassandra compaction and repair tasks found locally.

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources app: Problem when opening the element list in the 'device' tab [ID_36239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you created a resource and then opened the element list in the *device* tab in order to link a device to that newly created resource, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive, especially when the element list contained a large number of elements.
