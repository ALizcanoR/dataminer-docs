### Enhancements

#### Failover: SLDataMiner will no longer be able to reclaim the virtual IP address when the agent goes offline [ID_34458]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When, in the *DMS.xml* file, the *bruteForceToOffline* option is specified in the `<Failover>` element, SLDataMiner will not be notified when the agent's state goes from online to offline. Up to now, this could lead to SLDataMiner reclaiming the virtual IP address as it was not aware of any state change. Both agents would then incorrectly have the same virtual IP address.

From now on, when the *bruteForceToOffline* option is specified in the *DMS.xml* file, SLDataMiner will be asked to set the agent's state to offline and to not reclaim the virtual IP address before it has been released.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when editing an element [ID_34329]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when you edited an element.

#### Web apps: List box items not displayed correctly in embedded visual overviews [ID_34474]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.11 -->

In an embedded visual overview, in some cases, list box items would not be displayed correctly.

#### Standalone DVE parameter partially included in an service would incorrectly not affect service state severity [ID_34493]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a parameter of a DVE element exported as a standalone parameter was partially included in a service, in some cases, the service state could be incorrect.

#### Web apps - Visual Overview: New values would incorrectly be added to listboxes each time those listboxes got updated [ID_34515]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

In Visio pages displayed in web apps, new values would incorrectly be added to listboxes each time those listboxes got updated.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem with measurement point option 'Invert spectrum' [ID_34552]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you had selected the *Invert spectrum* option while configuring a measurement point, in some cases, that option would incorrectly not be applied.
