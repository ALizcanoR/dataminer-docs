# General Main Release 10.1.0 CU19

### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: SurveyorSearchText variable continued to show cleared search input [ID_34114]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When the text in the Cube advanced search box was selected with Ctrl+A and then deleted, it could occur that the advanced search input was not cleared correctly, so that it continued to be shown by the *SurveyorSearchText* variable in Visual Overview.

#### Visual Overview: Connection highlight based on connection property not updated automatically [ID_34139]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a connection in Visual Overview was highlighted based on a connection property, and the connection property changed, it could occur that the highlight style was not automatically applied to the connection line, but only after the user triggered a redraw, for example by clicking the highlight.
