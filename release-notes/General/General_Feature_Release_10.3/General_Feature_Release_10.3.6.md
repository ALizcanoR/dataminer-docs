## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Object Models: Enhanced performance when reading DOM objects and ModuleSettings [ID_35934]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when reading DOM objects and ModuleSettings.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects SyncInfo files [ID_35995]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include all files found in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SyncInfo` relevant for troubleshooting.

#### Service & Resource Management: An error will now be thrown when an SRM event has been stuck for more than 15 minutes [ID_36013]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When an SRM event has been stuck for more than 15 minutes, the following run-time error will now appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Thread problem in SLNet: SRM event thread for booking with id <booking id>
```

This error will also be added to the *SLWatchDog2.txt* log file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This run-time error will appear when a custom booking event script that was configured to run synchronously has been running for more than 15 minutes. We highly recommend configuring custom booking events to run asynchronously. For more information, see [Service Orchestration custom events configuration](xref:Service_Orchestration_custom_events).
> - Half-open run-time errors (which are thrown after an SRM event has been stuck for more than 7.5 minutes) will also be added to the *SLWatchDog2.txt* log file.

#### SLAnalytics: Trend data predictions displayed in trend graphs will be more accurate [ID_36038]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements with regard to the detection of periodic behavior in trend data, the trend data predictions displayed in trend graphs will be more accurate.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Agent was not able to connect to the Cassandra database due to a problem with the TLS certificate [ID_35895]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a DataMiner Agent was restarted after its database had been configured to use TLS, in some cases, it would not be able to connect to its Cassandra database due to a problem with the TLS certificate validation.

#### Updating a Resource or ResourcePool would incorrectly cause the 'CreatedAt' and 'CreatedBy' fields to be overwritten [ID_35913]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a Resource or ResourcePool was updated, the *CreatedAt* and *CreatedBy* fields would incorrectly be overwritten.

#### NATS-related error: 'Failed to copy credentials from [IP address] - corrupt zip file' [ID_35935]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some rare cases, the following NATS-related error would be thrown:

```txt
Failed to copy credentials from [IP address] - corrupt zip file
```

#### Creating or updating a function resource while its parent element was in an error state would incorrectly be allowed [ID_35963]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you created or updated a function resource while its parent element was in an error state, up to now, the state of that parent element would not be checked correctly. As a result, adding or updating the function resource would incorrectly be allowed.

From now on, when you create or update a function resource while its parent element is in an error state, an error will be thrown.

#### Business Intelligence: Problem when a replicated SLA was stopped or deleted [ID_35973]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, an error could occur when a replicated SLA was stopped or deleted.

#### Cassandra: Cleared alarms would incorrectly be added to the activealarms table and never removed [ID_36002]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

Cleared alarms would incorrectly be added to the activealarms table and never removed.

#### Spectrum analysis: Measurement points would not be set correctly [ID_36005]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, measurement points would not be set correctly when a trace was being displayed.

#### Virtual functions linked to a parameter with a hysteresis timer could be assigned an incorrect alarm severity [ID_36024]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a virtual function was linked to a parameter that had a hysteresis timer running, in some cases, that virtual function would be assigned an incorrect alarm severity.

#### NT Notify type NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA would return incorrect values [ID_36025]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, NT Notify type NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA (269) would return incorrect bitrate counter values when an SNMPv3 element was going into or coming out of a timeout state.

#### SLReset.exe would not clean an Elasticsearch database when no <DB> element was specified in DB.xml [ID_36040]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When, in the *DB.xml* file, no `<DB>` element was specified for an Elasticsearch database, the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* would not clean that database when the `cleanclustereddatabases` option had been used.

From now on, when no `<DB>` element is specified for a Elasticsearch database, *SLReset.exe* will use the default database name "dms".

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: No flatline stop events would be generated when an element was deleted [ID_36050]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When an element was deleted, no flatline stop events would be generated for parameters of that element.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Problem when creating a DomInstance with an empty status [ID_36063]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a DomInstance was created with an empty status, in some cases, a `MultipleSectionsNotAllowedForSectionDefinition` error could be returned, even when the configuration was correct.

#### Errors would incorrectly state that OpenSearch 2.4 and 2.5 were not supported [ID_36137]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

Although DataMiner supports all OpenSearch 1.x and 2.x versions, in some cases, errors stating that OpenSearch 2.4 and 2.5 were not officially supported would incorrectly be added to the *SLDBConnection.txt* and *SLSearch.txt* log files.
