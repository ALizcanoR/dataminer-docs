## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when creating or editing services [ID_35366]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made with regard to the communication between SLDataMiner and SLDMS, overall performance has increased when creating or editing services, especially in heavily loaded environments.

#### Enhanced SNMP trap distribution [ID_35480]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, stopped elements will no longer be taken into account when distributing SNMP traps. When a trap has to be sent to an element on another DataMiner Agent, it will no longer be sent when that element is stopped.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the alarm storm threshold was exceeded [ID_35545]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, focus value updates will no longer be taken into account when determining whether the alarm storm threshold was exceeded.

### Fixes

#### Failover: Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online [ID_35534]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a failover was triggered, in some rare cases, the Profile Manager would incorrectly not be initialized on the agent that was brought online.

In the Alarm Console, an error would appear with the following message:

```txt
Unexpected exception while triggering failover for BaseProfileManager: Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException: Exception of type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Net.ManagerStore.CrudFailedException' was thrown.
```

#### Problem when modifying the production version of a protocol with an SNMPv3 connection [ID_35538]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you modified the production version of a protocol with multiple connections, of which one was an SNMNv3 connection, in some cases, the element could lose its SNMPv3 port settings. As a result, the SLSNMPManager process would fail to initialize the SNMPv3 communication, and the following alarm would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Error parsing SNMPv3 password for port: <port number> on element: <element name>
```

Also, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when you tried to re-enter the SNMPv3 port settings.
