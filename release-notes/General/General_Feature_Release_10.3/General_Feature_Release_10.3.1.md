## Other features

#### SLNetClientTest tool - 'Connect' window: Enhanced 'Connection Type' and 'Authentication' sections [ID_34712]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In the *SLNetClientTest* tool, to connect to a DataMiner Agent, you select *Connection* > *Connect*, and specify the necessary information in the *Connect* window. That window has now been updated.

In the *Connection Type* section, you now have to indicate how the connection has to be established:

| Select...              | in order to... |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Autodetect             | connect to the local machine or a remote machine using the method that will be detected automatically. |
| gRPC                   | connect to the local machine or a remote machine via the APIGateway service using the GRPCWeb protocol.<br>When you choose this option, you can specify a custom port (default: `443`) and a custom endpoint (default: `/APIGateway`). |
| .NET Remoting (legacy) | connect to the local machine or a remote machine using .NET Remoting.<br>When you choose this option, you can specify a custom port (default: `8004`) |
| IPC (only local)       | connect to the local machine using IPC. |

In the *Authentication* section (formerly known as *User Info* section), you now have the following authentication options:

- Single sign-on
- Explicit credentials (with *Force Authenticate Local User* option)
- Ticket

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced parameter locking in SLElement [ID_34688]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.1 [CU0] -->

In SLElement, a number of enhancements have been made with regard to parameter locking.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects DxM version info and APIGateway app settings [ID_34701]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include:

- Version information of all DataMiner Extension Modules (DxM).
- The appsettings.json file of the APIGateway service.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Enhanced method to delete locked files [ID_34779]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When, during a DataMiner upgrade, an attempt was made to delete files that were locked by certain processes, up to now, that attempt would fail, causing those files to remain on the system until the next upgrade.

From now on, when an attempt to delete a file during a DataMiner upgrade fails, the extension of that file will be replaced by `.SLReplace` and, later on in the upgrade process, the file will then be deleted by SLHelper.

#### Size of log entries in log files generated by SLLog will now be limited [ID_34801]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

In log files generated by SLLog, the size of the entries will now be limited:

- Messages will be trimmed to 5120 characters.
- Methods will be trimmed to 200 characters.
- Program names will be trimmed to 200 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> Method data typically also includes the process and thread IDs.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app - Time range feed: Quick pick buttons would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34759]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a time range feed was configured to show quick pick buttons, those buttons would not be displayed in the correct order. From now on, quick pick buttons will be displayed in chronological order.

#### Standalone parameters belonging to another child of the same DVE parent element could be set to 'Not Initialized' when a row linked to a DVE child element was deleted [ID_34785]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU22] / 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a row linked to a DVE child element was deleted, in some cases, standalone parameters belonging to another child of the same DVE parent element could be set to "Not Initialized".

#### GQI: Filter operations would not be forwarded to the correct query when multiple data sources were joined [ID_34819]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When multiple data sources were joined, in some cases, filter operations would not be forwarded to the correct query.

#### GQI: Problem when retrieving DCF interfaces [ID_34820]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a GQI query returned all DCF interfaces from all agents in the DataMiner System, the NATS message broker would throw a *MaxPayloadException* when *MaxPayload* exceeded the value configured in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS\nats-streaming-server\nats-server.config`.

From now on, when a GQI query has to retrieve DCF interfaces, it will do so by querying one agent at a time.

#### Known Elasticsearch errors would incorrectly get logged in the SLSearch.txt log file [ID_34827]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

Up to now, when custom data was requested by ID from an Elasticsearch database, a "404" error would be logged in the *SLSearch.txt* log file when the ID did not exist.

From now on, only unknown Elasticsearch errors will be logged in the *SLSearch.txt* log file. Known errors will be logged as level-5 errors in the debug logs.

#### Memory leak in SLDataGateway during a Cassandra Cluster migration [ID_34829]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.1 -->

During a Cassandra Cluster migration, SLDataGateway would leak memory due to paging handlers not being cleaned up correctly.
