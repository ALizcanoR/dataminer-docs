#### DataMiner installation/upgrade: Automatic installation of DataMiner Extension Modules [ID_36085]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you install or upgrade a DataMiner Agent, the following DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs) will now automatically be installed (if not present yet):

- DataMiner ArtifactDeployer (version 1.4.5)
- DataMiner CoreGateway (version 2.12.2)
- DataMiner FieldControl (version 2.8.3)
- DataMiner Orchestrator (version 1.3.3)
- DataMiner SupportAssistant (version 1.3.2)

An upgrade action is also included that will check if the cloud endpoint hosted in CloudGateway will be reachable (TCP port 5100).

In addition, the DataMiner installer will now also add a firewall rule allowing inbound TCP port 5100 communication.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when retrieving resources [ID_36129]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving resources.

#### Failover: Obsolete CheckVIPs thread has been removed [ID_36253]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In Failover setups using virtual IP addresses, once every minute the CheckVIPs thread would check whether the online Agent holds the correct IP addresses. However, due to the many locks it claimed to verify the current state of the IP addresses, it would delay other actions being executed in the system.

This obsolete thread has now been removed.
