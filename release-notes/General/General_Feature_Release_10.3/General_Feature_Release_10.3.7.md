## Other features

#### DataMiner installation/upgrade: Automatic installation of DataMiner Extension Modules [ID_36085]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you install or upgrade a DataMiner Agent, the following DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs) will now automatically be installed (if not present yet):

- DataMiner ArtifactDeployer (version 1.4.5)
- DataMiner CoreGateway (version 2.12.2)
- DataMiner FieldControl (version 2.8.3)
- DataMiner Orchestrator (version 1.3.3)
- DataMiner SupportAssistant (version 1.3.2)

The BPA test *Firewall Configuration* has been altered to also check if TCP port 5100 is properly configured in the firewall. This port is required for communication with the cloud via the endpoint hosted in DataMiner CloudGateway.

In addition, the DataMiner installer will now also add a firewall rule allowing inbound TCP port 5100 communication.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information on the changes included in the different versions of these DxMs, refer to the [dataminer.services change log](xref:DCP_change_log).

#### Marker images can now also be generated dynamically in layers with sourceType set to objects [ID_36246]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

Marker images can now also be generated dynamically in layers with `sourceType` set to "objects".

To generate a marker image dynamically, you can use placeholders in the `url` attribute of the *\<MarkerImage\>* tag.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when retrieving resources [ID_36129]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving resources.

#### Failover: Obsolete CheckVIPs thread has been removed [ID_36253]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In Failover setups using virtual IP addresses, once every minute the CheckVIPs thread would check whether the online Agent holds the correct IP addresses. However, due to the many locks it claimed to verify the current state of the IP addresses, it would delay other actions being executed in the system.

This obsolete thread has now been removed.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced logic to determine which function DVEs to deactivate [ID_36299]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

Up to now, when the function manager needed to deactivate function DVEs because the threshold was reached, it could do so for resources that were needed for bookings being started of which the status was not yet "ongoing". From now on, function DVEs will no longer be deactivated when they are part of a booking that is either confirmed or ongoing.

### Fixes

#### Service & Resource Management: Contributing resources of which the contributing booking had ended would not be marked available [ID_35757]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When updating an ongoing main booking that made use of a contributing resource of which the contributing booking had already ended, the ResourceManager would incorrectly mark the contributing resource as unavailable. As a result, the update would fail and the main booking would go into quarantine with reason "ContributingResourceNotAvailable".

Also, a *GetEligibleResources* call would not return the contributing resource.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when loading service profile instances [ID_35878]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading service profile instances.

#### Business Intelligence: Secondary index of certain SLA logger tables would not be created correctly [ID_36245]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

The secondary index of certain SLA logger tables would not be created correctly. As a result, certain rows in those tables would not get cleaned up and exceptions like the following would be added to the *SLDBConnection.txt* log file:

```txt
SLDataGateway.Types.DBGatewayException: CassandraConnection ExecuteQuery - exception while executing query: SELECT "array_active_service_alarms_id","array_active_service_alarms_time" FROM ELEMENTDATA_7102_1334_750 WHERE "array_active_service_alarms_rootid" = '0/0'; - Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING
```

When SLAs were stored in a Cassandra cluster, none of their rows would get cleaned up.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when updating a booking while actions were being performed [ID_36268]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When a booking was updated while actions were being performed, in some cases, it could become corrupted.

For example, when a booking was rescheduled while it was being started, it could end up in an *Ongoing* status with a start time somewhere in the future.

#### Client connection would be dropped because an SLNet request handled by SLHelper took too long to process [ID_36296]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When it took SLHelper more than 15 minutes to process an SLNet request received from a client, a NATS exception was returned to the client. However, as this exception was not serialized, the client would not receive it, causing the client connection to get dropped.

From now on, NATS exceptions returned to a client following an SLHelper timeout will always be serialized.

#### Protocols: QAction syntax errors did not refer to the correct lines [ID_36301]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

Up to now, before a QAction was compiled, three compiler directives were added to its source code. As a result, all compilation errors would refer to incorrect line numbers.

From now on, the compiler directives will no longer be added to the source code. Instead, they will be passed to the compiler directly.

#### SLNetClientTest: Problem when trying to set up a connection using gRPC [ID_36322]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When the *SLNetClientTest* tool tried to set up a connection using gRPC, a `MissingMethodException` exception could be thrown.

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.
