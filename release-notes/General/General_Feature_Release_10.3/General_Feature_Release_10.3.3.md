## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected for this release yet*

## Other features

#### Dashboards app - GQI: New data sources [ID_35027] [ID_34965] [ID_35058]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the Generic Query Interface, the following new data sources are now available:

- Get trend data patterns
- Get trend data pattern events
- Get behavioral change events

The *Get trend data pattern events* and *Get behavioral change events* data sources contain time range metadata on each row. Each time range holds the start and end time of the event in question. When a table row is selected, the time range will be exposed as a feed.

#### DataMiner Object Models: New field descriptors [ID_35278]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Two new field descriptors have been added to the DataMiner Object Models:

- GroupFieldDescriptor: Can be used to define that a field should contain the name of a DataMiner user group.

- UserFieldDescriptor: Can be used to define that a field should contain the name of a DataMiner user. There is a *GroupNames* property that can be used to define which groups the user can be a part of.

#### GQI: Multiple groupBy operations can now be applied after an aggregation operation [ID_35355]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

After an aggregation operation, you can now apply multiple groupBy operations.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_34894] [ID_35331]

<!-- RN 34894: MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->
<!-- RN 35331: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Elasticsearch: 'Request Entity Too Large (413)' errors will now be prevented when writing data in bulk [ID_34937]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When data was written to Elasticsearch in bulk, up to now, DataMiner would throw a `Request Entity Too Large (413)` error when the amount of data exceeded the 100 MB limit.

From now on, DataMiner will detect when too much data is being sent in a single request and will split up the data into smaller parts.

#### SLLogCollector: Multiple instances can now be run simultaneously [ID_35204]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Multiple instances of the SLLogCollector tool can now be run simultaneously.

#### Web apps: Enhanced color picker [ID_35276]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the color picker.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: Manually created tags will now be saved as pattern occurrences [ID_35299]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when you define a tag for pattern matching, the pattern you selected will be saved as a pattern occurrence in the Elasticsearch database and highlighted in bright orange, similar to so-called "streaming matches", which are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated.

#### Dashboards - Line & area chart component: 'Show average', 'Show minimum' and 'Show maximum' options will now be taken into account when exporting trend data to CSV [ID_35311]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->
<!-- Timestamp format fix added to Fixes -->

When exporting trend data to CSV, from now on, the *Show average*, *Show minimum* and *Show maximum* options will be taken into account.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When the *Show min/max shading* option is enabled (which it is by default), minimum and maximum values will always be included when you export trend data.
> - As the *Show min/max shading* option and the *Show average* option are both enabled by default, a CSV export of trend data will by default contain all trend data values.

#### Errors received from the web API after sending a GetConnection call will now be logged in SLNet.txt [ID_35313]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when SLNet receives an error from the web API after sending a *GetConnection* call, it will log the request and the response in the *SLNet.txt* log file.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Suggestion events and alarm events for a DVE child element will now be generated on that same DVE child element [ID_35332]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a behavioral anomaly was detected on a DVE child element, up to now, the suggestion event or the alarm event would be generated on the parent element. From now on, it will be generated on the child element instead.

#### Maps: Markers will now move more gradual when zooming [ID_35337]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, markers will now move more gradual when zooming.

#### Alarm templates - Smart baseline calculations: NullReferenceException prevented & enhanced exception logging [ID_35348]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, a `Baseline Calculation Failed: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` error would be added to the *SLSmartBaselineManager.txt* log file. The issue causing that error has now been fixed.

Also, log entries indicating an exception thrown during baseline calculations will now include details regarding the element and parameter associated with the exception.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Installation of Microsoft .NET 6.0 [ID_35363]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, Microsoft .NET 6.0 will now be installed if not installed already.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLLog when logging large entries regarding failed Elasticsearch query requests/responses [ID_35037]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Up to now, an error could occur in SLLog when adding large entries regarding failed Elasticsearch query requests/responses.

#### When a direct view table was updated, the wrong columns could be updated in the source element [ID_35075]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a direct view table was updated while one of the source elements was stopped, due to a column translation issue, the wrong columns could be updated in that source element the moment it was started again.

#### SLDataGateway would leak memory when offloading average trend data for DVE elements [ID_35167]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

The SLDataGateway process would leak memory when offloading average trend data for DVE elements.

#### Service & Resource Management: Setting a new function file to active would incorrectly not cause the function DVEs of elements using a production version of the protocol to be updated [ID_35178]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a new function file was set to active, up to now, the function DVEs of elements using a production version of the protocol in question would incorrectly not be updated.

#### GQI: Problem when fetching two queries using an external data source with a custom argument of which the ID was set to "Type" [ID_35242]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When two queries using an external data source with a custom argument of which the ID was set to "Type" had to be fetched, only one of the two queries would get fetched when the only difference between them was the value of the custom argument.

#### Dashboards app: Problem when trying to open a shared dashboard [ID_35271]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When users tried to open a shared dashboard, in some cases, they would unexpectedly be presented with a login screen due to a permission issue.

Workaround: Recreate the faulty shared dashboard.

#### SLDataGateway could end up with an excessive number of HealthMonitor.Refresh threads [ID_35286]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, the SLDataGateway process could end up with an excessive number of *HealthMonitor.Refresh* threads.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Permission checks for DOM modules requiring view permission 'None' were too strict [ID_35305]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

If a DOM module is created without specifying *SecuritySettings*, the view permission is set to "None".

Up to now, the check to determine whether a user had the view permission set to "None", would only return true for the Administrator or users in the Administrator group. From now on, when the required view permission is "None", permission checks will no longer be performed.

#### Dashboards - Line & area chart component: Timestamps could be formatted incorrectly when exporting trend data to CSV [ID_35311]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->
<!-- See Enhancements for rest of 35311 -->

When trend data was exported to a CSV file, up to now, timestamps could be formatted incorrectly.

#### Cassandra: TTL setting of spectrum trace data would not be applied correctly [ID_35385]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In a Cassandra database, the "time to live" (TTL) setting of spectrum trace data would not be applied correctly. As a result, this type of data would never be removed.

#### Web apps: Problems with Visual Overview components [ID_35399]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

A number of issues regarding the Visual Overview component have been fixed.

- In some cases, the Visual Overview component would send an excessive amount of polling requests.
- When a page was selected in the Visual Overview component, in some cases, an incorrect page would be displayed.
- In some cases, the dimensions of pop-up windows would be incorrect.
- When a pop-up window was shown using a *VdxShape* property, in some cases, the default page would be shown instead of the page that was specified.
