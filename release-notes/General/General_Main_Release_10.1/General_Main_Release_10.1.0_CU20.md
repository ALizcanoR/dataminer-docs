### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_34251]

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLSNMPManager: Enhanced performance [ID_33940]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the SLSNMPManager process has improved.

#### Performance improvement to update service state more quickly [ID_34165]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a performance improvement, the calculated service alarm state will now be updated more quickly in the client.

#### Enhanced performance when querying large XML files [ID_34299]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made to SLXML, overall performance has increased when querying large XML files.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Service context of a linked shape will only be determined when the service context has been specified [ID_34340]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When a shape was linked to an element that was not part of a service, up to now, an attempt would be made to determine the service context even when no service context had been specified. From now on, the service context will only be determined when the service context has been specified in the shape.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced performance when sorting dynamically positioned shapes [ID_34351]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when sorting dynamically positioned shapes.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced shape positioning [ID_34356]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when setting the X and Y position of a shape.

#### Lingering connections towards a DataMiner Agent will now be forcefully killed [ID_34367]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, connections between DMAs can leak TCP connections, causing new connections towards port 8004 to fail due to port exhaustion.

Up to now, when a new connection towards port 8004 failed, the following entry was logged in the SLNet log file:

``` txt
Connection to {0} via external process succeeds while same connection via SLNet process fails since {1} ({2} times) => possible lingering TCP connections issue
```

From now on, the connection in question will also be forcefully killed.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Caching of user settings in order to enhanced performance [ID_34383]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In Visual Overview, the current value of the following user settings will now be cached in order to enhance performance:

- *Open element cards undocked* (*Settings* window)
- *AlarmSettings.Blinking* (*MaintenanceSettings.xml* file)

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced performance when determining whether a shape is clickable [ID_34386]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the procedure called to determine whether a shape is clickable.

#### 'Repair DB.bat' script now also supports MySQL Server 5.5 [ID_34429]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

The `Repair DB.bat` script, located in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools` folder, now also supports MySQL Server 5.5.

### Fixes

#### Dashboard Gateway (legacy): Dashboards would fail to show the Maps component when the DMA had HTTPS configured [ID_33777]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When a legacy Dashboard Gateway was connected to a DataMiner Agent with HTTPS configured and port 80 blocked, dashboards would fail to show the Maps component.

#### Protocols - Multi-threaded timers: Empty poll groups would cause SLProtocol to send empty SNMP requests to SLSNMPManager [ID_33900]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When multi-threaded timers were used in an SNMP protocol, the timer would incorrectly always execute the poll group, even if it did not specify any OIDs to be polled.

From now on, an empty group will no longer cause SLProtocol to send an empty SNMP request to SLSNMPManager.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem with conditional shape manipulation actions 'Show' and 'Hide' [ID_34108]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When, in a particular shape, you had specified a *Show* or *Hide* action with a condition, the shape would incorrectly always be visible, whether the condition was true or false.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Y axis would incorrectly show other values when the trend graph showed a constant exception value [ID_34242]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you opened a trend graph that only showed a constant exception value, the Y axis would incorrectly not only show the exception value but also a number of other values. In cases like this, from now on, the Y axis will only show the exception value.

#### Problem when deserializing an overridden parameter description [ID_34266]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When a JSON string containing an overridden parameter description was deserialized to an ElementInfo message, in some cases, an exception would be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Y-axis values did not take into account the number of decimals configured in the protocol.xml file [ID_34269]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you opened a trend graph, the Y-axis values would incorrectly not take into account the number of decimals configured in the *protocol.xml* file for the parameters in question.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Problem when entering an invalid value in a numeric component [ID_34310]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you entered an invalid value in a numeric component, the *UIResults.GetString()* method would incorrectly not return that invalid value. Instead, it returned the last valid value that had been entered.

#### DataMiner Cube - EPM: Not possible to add a second parameter to a trend graph of an EPM object [ID_34323]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you opened a trend graph of an EPM object, it would not be possible to add a second parameter. After you had added a new parameter, the drop-down box would incorrectly only contain the current parameter.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum analysis: Preset would not be loaded when clicking 'View buffer' [ID_34357]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When, in a Spectrum card, you clicked *View buffer*, the preset contained inside the buffer would incorrectly not be loaded. As a result, incorrect threshold values would be displayed.

#### Dashboards app / Low-code apps: Creating a custom theme with a custom color palette would incorrectly cause the color palette of all built-in themes to be updated [ID_34368]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

Creating a custom theme with a custom color palette would incorrectly cause the color palette of all built-in themes to be updated.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem when receiving a DCF connection line update [ID_34375]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

An error could occur when the client received a DCF connection line update.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when reading incorrectly configured port settings [ID_34379]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLProtocol when reading incorrectly configured port settings.

#### Problem with SLLog when closing a log file [ID_34385]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLLog when closing a log file.

#### Dashboards app: Side panel context menu and selected dashboard would overlap each other [ID_34411]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When you opened the context menu of the side panel, in some cases, the context menu and the dashboard selected in the list would overlap each other.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when loading an alarm tab with hyperlink columns [ID_34420]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

In some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive when loading an alarm tab with hyperlink columns, especially when that alarm tab contained a large number of alarms.

#### Web Services API: Problem when calling the GetBooking or GetBookings method via SOAP [ID_34466]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU20]/10.2.0 [CU8] - Feature Release Version 10.2.11 -->

When the GetBooking or GetBookings method was called via SOAP, in some cases, a serialization exception could be thrown when the booking (in case of GetBooking) or one of the bookings (in case of GetBookings) had a property that contained a TimeSpan object.
