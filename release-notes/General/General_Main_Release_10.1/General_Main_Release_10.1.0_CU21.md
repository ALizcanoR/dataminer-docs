### Enhancements

#### Preventing multiple SLScripting processes from simultaneously compiling the same DLL [ID_34532]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

On systems with multiple SLScripting processes, in some cases, these processes could incorrectly compile the same DLL at the same time. As a result, elements would then throw `Compilation failed` errors and would not execute their QActions.

Now, an inter-process lock has been added to make sure only one thread and process can build a given DLL.

Moreover, when a QAction is being compiled, other elements will wait for 5 minutes. They will then throw an exception and an element restart will be required. This timeout will make sure that, if something unexpectedly would go wrong, there is still a chance to recover from the situation without having to restart DataMiner.

#### Enhanced performance of the DataMiner startup routine [ID_34545]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR TBD -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the DataMiner startup routine has increased.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects network information [ID_34582]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include the following additional files containing network information:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| Logs\Network Information\ipconfig.exe _all.txt | The output of an `ipconfig /all` command. |
| Logs\Network Information\route.exe print.txt   | The output of a `route print` command.    |

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when editing an element [ID_34329]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when you edited an element.

#### Standalone DVE parameter partially included in an service would incorrectly not affect service state severity [ID_34493]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a parameter of a DVE element exported as a standalone parameter was partially included in a service, in some cases, the service state could be incorrect.

#### Enabling conditional monitoring for a parameter would incorrectly cause iStatus -17 data points to be offloaded even when the trend data of that parameter had been excluded from offloads [ID_34540]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When, in an alarm template, you enabled conditional monitoring for a parameter, the iStatus -17 data points would incorrectly also be offloaded to the offload database when, in the trend template linked to that parameter, its trend data had been excluded from offloads.

#### Not all data would be cleaned up after deleting elements in bulk on systems with a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server database [ID_34542]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU21]/10.2.0 [CU9] - Feature Release Version 10.2.12 -->

When, on systems with a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server database, elements had been deleted in bulk (e.g. via an Automation script), in some cases, real-time trending, average trending, alarms, information events and certain reporter caching tables would incorrectly not be cleaned up.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem with measurement point option 'Invert spectrum' [ID_34552]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you had selected the *Invert spectrum* option while configuring a measurement point, in some cases, that option would incorrectly not be applied.

#### Offload limit would not be taken into account when offloading files to a file cache [ID_34564]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

To have files offloaded to a file cache instead of to a database, in the *DB.xml* file, you can add a `<FileCache>` tag like the following.

However, up to now, the file cache offload limit (default: 10 GB) would incorrectly not be taken into account.

```xml
<DataBase active="true" local = "false">
    <FileCache enabled="true">
        <MaxSizeKB>10000</MaxSizeKB>
    </FileCache>
</DataBase>
```

#### Problem with SLElement when rows were deleted from a table with an open subscription [ID_34578]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement when rows were deleted from a table with an open subscription.

#### DataMiner Maps: Loading screen would incorrectly stay visible after the map had been loaded [ID_34587]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When DataMiner Maps v1 was used with Google Maps as provider, in some cases, the *Loading Google Maps...* screen would incorrectly stay visible after the map had been loaded.
