### Fixes

#### Alarm Console: Alarms would incorrectly be grouped when the 'Automatically group according to arrangement' was not selected [ID_34153]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

When, in the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the Alarm Console, the *Automatically group according to arrangement* setting was not selected, upon reconnecting DataMiner Cube, the alarms would incorrectly be grouped anyway.

#### DataMiner Cube - Services app: No services would be loaded the first time you opened the Services app [ID_34211]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

When you opened the *Services* app for the first time after opening DataMiner Cube, in some cases, no services would be loaded. The services would only be loaded when you closed the *Services* app and opened it again.
