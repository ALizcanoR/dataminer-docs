## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Automatic incident tracking will now make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the ModelHost DxM [ID_34684]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

The *automatic incident tracking* feature groups active alarms that are related to the same incident, so that the Alarm Console provides a better overview of the current issues in the system. From now on, on cloud-connected DataMiner Agents that have the DataMiner Extension Module *ModelHost* installed and that have been configured to [offload alarm and change point events to the cloud](xref:Controlling_cloudfeed_data_offloads), this feature will also make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the *ModelHost* DxM.

### Fixes
