## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: New toggle buttons added to Buttons stencil [ID_34426]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

The Buttons stencil now contains the following additional buttons:

- *tb-var-l* (button on left side, text on right side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)
- *tb-var-r* (button on right side, text on left side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)

Other changes made to the Buttons stencil:

- Buttons *abtn-automation* and *lbtn-automation* have been combined into one button *btn-automation*.
- Button *btn-popup* now has configurable window settings.

#### Trending - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced detection of flatline changes [ID_34487]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->
<!-- Not added to 10.3.0 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy when detecting flatline changes has increased, especially in the following cases:

- When an element becomes inactive or is paused.
- When an element is deleted.
- When a table parameter is no longer active.

Any alarm or suggestion events created for flatline changes will now close sooner when one of the above-mentioned situations occurs.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem with measurement point option 'Invert spectrum' [ID_34552]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you had selected the *Invert spectrum* option while configuring a measurement point, in some cases, that option would incorrectly not be applied.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Parameter controls displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube [ID_34575]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

A parameter control displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube. As a result, the read and write parameters would be formatted differently.

#### Visual Overview: Dynamically generated shapes sorted by custom property value would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34617]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a large number of shapes generated based on child items in a view were sorted by a custom property value, in some rare cases, those shapes would not be displayed in the correct order.
