## Other features

#### Trending: When trending a parameter, related parameters can now be added through light bulb icon [ID_34432]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When trending a parameter, you can now add related parameters by clicking the light bulb icon in the top-right corner of the trend. In doing so, you will get an overview of suggested parameters that are related to the currently displayed parameter trend.

#### Visual Overview - ListView component : 'Reservation.Start' and 'Reservation.End' columns can now be configured to convert date/time values to the current time zone [ID_34512]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Up to now, when you added the columns *Reservation.Start* and *Reservation.End* to a ListView component configured to list bookings, the date/time values in those columns would always be interpreted as UTC values. From now on, if you set the type of those columns to "Date InvariantCulture", the date/time values in those columns will be converted to the time zone specified in the Cube settings.

#### Server-side search: New option 'includeAllCustomProperties' [ID_34541]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, you can configure the DataMiner Cube server-side search engine by specifying one or more search options in the *SLNet.SearchOptions* element.

If you specify the new *includeAllCustomProperties* option, the server-side search engine will now search the values of all custom properties. Up to now, the search engine would by default only search the values of the custom properties that were displayed in the Surveyor.

For more information on the available search options, see [Setting the indexing options for the server-side search](xref:Setting_the_indexing_options_for_the_server-side_search).

Also, from now on, DataMiner Cube will call the server-side search engine when you enter a numeric search string like "1234". Up to now, when you entered a numeric search string, DataMiner Cube would perform a client-side search that would only return views of which the ID matched the search string.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: New toggle buttons added to Buttons stencil [ID_34426]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

The Buttons stencil now contains the following additional buttons:

- *tb-var-l* (button on left side, text on right side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)
- *tb-var-r* (button on right side, text on left side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)

Other changes made to the Buttons stencil:

- Buttons *abtn-automation* and *lbtn-automation* have been combined into one button *btn-automation*.
- Button *btn-popup* now has configurable window settings.

#### Trending - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced detection of flatline changes [ID_34487]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->
<!-- Not added to 10.3.0 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy when detecting flatline changes has increased, especially in the following cases:

- When an element becomes inactive or is paused.
- When an element is deleted.
- When a table parameter is no longer active.

Any alarm or suggestion events created for flatline changes will now close sooner when one of the above-mentioned situations occurs.

#### System Center: Link to online help now points to 'Connecting your DataMiner System to the cloud' on <https://docs.dataminer.services/> [ID_34683]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

On the *Cloud* page of *System Center*, the *online help* hyperlink now points to the [Connecting your DataMiner System to the cloud](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud) page on <https://docs.dataminer.services/>.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Y axis of trend graph would incorrectly show duplicate values [ID_34492]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a trend graph showed a constant value, due to a rounding issue, the Y axis would incorrectly show duplicate values.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem with measurement point option 'Invert spectrum' [ID_34552]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you had selected the *Invert spectrum* option while configuring a measurement point, in some cases, that option would incorrectly not be applied.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Parameter controls displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube [ID_34575]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

A parameter control displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube. As a result, the read and write parameters would be formatted differently.

#### Trending: Problem when duplicating table parameters with different values [ID_34591]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When duplicating a table parameter in the legend of a trend graph, the graph would not be displayed if the duplicate parameter did not have the same index value as the original parameter.

#### Trending: Table would be cleared of all data after refreshing [ID_34592]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When triggering a refresh of a trend chart, the data and axes on the line chart would disappear for a short period of time without first verifying whether there was any new incoming data. If the incoming data equals null, the graph should not be redrawn and should remain visible.

#### Visual Overview: Dynamically generated shapes sorted by custom property value would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34617]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a large number of shapes generated based on child items in a view were sorted by a custom property value, in some rare cases, those shapes would not be displayed in the correct order.
