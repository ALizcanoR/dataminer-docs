### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: Problem with element or view scope of Children shapes [ID_36354]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

In some cases, when a placeholder was used in the *Element* or *View* shape data field of a *Children* shape, the scope would not be updated when changes were made to the placeholder.

From now on, the scope will be updated correctly whenever changes are made to the placeholder in the *Element* or *View* shape data field.
