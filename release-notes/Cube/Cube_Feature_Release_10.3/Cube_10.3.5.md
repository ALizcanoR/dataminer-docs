## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Cube will now by default connect using gRPC when connecting to a cloud-connected DataMiner Agent with a remote access URL [ID_35779]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When you connect to a cloud-connected DataMiner Agent with a remote access URL ending in `*.dataminer.services`, Cube will now by default connect using gRPC.

### Fixes

#### Cube could start to consume excessive CPU cycles whenever an operation took a long time or a deadlock occurred [ID_35614]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Whenever an operation took a long time or a deadlock occurred, up to now, Cube could start to consume excessive CPU cycles.

#### Problems when Cube was configured to connect using gRPC [ID_35615]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When you had configured DataMiner Cube to connect using gRPC (by specifying `type=GRPCConnection` in the *ConnectionSettings.txt* file), the following issues could occur:

- The *About* and *Logging* windows would not be available on the login screen if .NET Remoting had been disabled on the DataMiner Agent.

- In some cases, Cube would become unresponsive when retrieving the user thumbnail pictures. These will now be retrieved in the background.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Base alarm updates would not be shown when the active alarms tab was filtered [ID_35845]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In a filtered active alarms tab, in some cases, a base alarm will match the filter while the correlated alarm will not. In that case, the base alarm will be shown while the correlated alarm will not.

However, up to now, when a base alarm was updated, the update would not be reflected in the Alarm Console until the filter was removed.
