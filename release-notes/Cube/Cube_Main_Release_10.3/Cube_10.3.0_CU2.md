### Enhancements

#### Database TTL settings will now be limited to 10 years [ID_35533]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, DataMiner Cube will no longer accept database TTL settings that exceed 10 years.

### Fixes

#### Cube could start to consume excessive CPU cycles whenever an operation took a long time or a deadlock occurred [ID_35614]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Whenever an operation took a long time or a deadlock occurred, up to now, Cube could start to consume excessive CPU cycles.

#### Problems when Cube was configured to connect using gRPC [ID_35615]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When you had configured DataMiner Cube to connect using gRPC (by specifying `type=GRPCConnection` in the *ConnectionSettings.txt* file), the following issues could occur:

- The *About* and *Logging* windows would not be available on the login screen if .NET Remoting had been disabled on the DataMiner Agent.

- In some cases, Cube would become unresponsive when retrieving the user thumbnail pictures. These will now be retrieved in the background.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem with un-initialized Capacity property on DMAs running version 10.3.1 or 10.2.12 or earlier [ID_35854]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.2 [CU1] -->

As from DataMiner version 10.3.0/10.3.2, the *Capacity* property is no longer initialized on new resources. As a result, resources without this legacy property would cause server-side issues on DataMiner Agents running either version 10.3.1 or version 10.2.12 or earlier.

From now on, Cube will initialize the *Capacity* property if it detects that the DataMiner Agent is running one of the following versions:

- version 10.3.1 or
- version 10.2.12 or earlier.
