### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources app: Problem when opening the element list in the 'device' tab [ID_36239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you created a resource and then opened the element list in the *device* tab in order to link a device to that newly created resource, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive, especially when the element list contained a large number of elements.
