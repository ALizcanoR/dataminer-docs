### Enhancements

#### Monitoring app: Elements, services and views opened by clicking a Visio shape will open in the same tab instead of a new tab [ID_35781]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In the *Monitoring* app, from now on, elements, services and views opened by clicking a Visio shape will open in the same tab instead of a new tab.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Sticky component menus would no longer be fully visible after you had changed the number of dashboard columns [ID_35702]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Sticky component menus would no longer be fully visible after you had changed the number of dashboard columns.

#### Dashboards app & low-code apps: GQI components would incorrectly not clear their query row feed when refetching data [ID_35767]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.4 -->

GQI components would incorrectly not clear their query row feed when refetching data.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Duplicated component would not have the size as the original [ID_35804]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When you duplicated a component, the size of the duplicate would incorrectly be limited to 30 rows. From now on, when you duplicate a component, the duplicate will have the same size as the original.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Text boxes in the Layout tab would not update when you selected another component [ID_35851]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When, in the *Layout* tab, a text box (e.g. the box containing the title of the selected component) had the focus, and you selected another component, the text box in the *Layout* tab would incorrectly still contain the value of the previously selected component.
