### Enhancements

#### Low-Code Apps - Action editor: 'Which scheduler?' button has now been renamed to 'Which timeline?' [ID_36530]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

In the action editor, the *Which scheduler?* button has now been renamed to *Which timeline?*.

### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps: Application would be updated each time you hit a key after changing a page name [ID_36479]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When you changed the name of a low-code app page, the application would incorrectly be updated each time you hit a key. From now on, the application will be updated 250 ms after the last keystroke.
