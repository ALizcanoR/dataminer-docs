### Enhancements

#### GQI: Enhanced behavior of aggregations applied on empty Elasticsearch tables [ID_36490]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, when an aggregation (min, max, average) was applied on an empty Elasticsearch table, the following exception would be thrown:

`Error trapped: Elastic returned unexpected value ''.`

From now on, when an aggregation (min, max, average) is applied on an empty Elasticsearch table, an empty cell will be returned instead.

Because of this change, the behavior of aggregations applied on all types of empty tables becomes more consistent:

| Type | RawValue | DisplayValue |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Avg/Min/Max/Median | null | "Not applicable" |
| (Distinct) Count   | 0    | 0                |
| Std dev/Percentile | null | "Not applicable" |
| Sum                | 0    | 0                |
