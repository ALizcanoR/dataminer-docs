### Enhancements

#### GQI - Parameter table: Timestamps will now be displayed using the time zone configured in ClientSettings.json [ID_35515]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

GQI queries against the following data sources will now return all parameter values of type date/time in the timezone configured in the *ClientSettings.json* file.

- Get parameters for element where
- Get parameter table by alias
- Get parameter table by ID

Up to now, these values were always displayed in UTC.

#### Web Services API v1: Updated descriptions of GetAlarmHistory and GetAlarmDetails methods [ID_35651]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In the following interface files, the descriptions of the *GetAlarmHistory* and *GetAlarmDetails* methods have been updated:

```txt
http://DmaNameOrIpAddress/API/v1/soap.asmx
http://DmaNameOrIpAddress/API/v1/json.asmx
```

New description of the *GetAlarmHistory* method:

> Get the alarm history for the specified alarm (optional full tree request). Use root alarm ID with requestFullTree for the details of a cleared non-root alarm.

New description of the *GetAlarmDetails* method:

> Get the alarm details for the specified alarm (use GetAlarmHistory for the details of a cleared non-root alarm).

### Fixes

#### Web apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Component of type 'Time' would not be displayed as a time span picker [ID_35435]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In a web app, an interactive Automation script component of type `Time` with configuration options of type `AutomationTimeUpDownOptions` would incorrectly not be displayed as a time span picker.

Also, a number of enhancements have been made:

- In web app environments, configuration options of type `AutomationTimeUpDownOptions` now have a new `ShowTimeUnits`property. When this property is set to true, the component will display labels indicating the days, hours, minutes and seconds. Default setting: false

- The hours, minutes and seconds of the time span component will get leading zeros after focus is lost.

- In a web app environment, a calendar component will now always show the picker button (as in Cube).

- When an interactive Automation script run in a web app environment contains executable components, a message will now be displayed, saying that executable components are not supported in web apps.

#### Web apps: An invalid value entered into a text box would incorrectly be replaced by the last valid value that was entered [ID_35489]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you entered an invalid value into a text box, an error message would be displayed for a very short moment, and the invalid value would incorrectly be replaced by the last valid value that was entered.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - GQI: Problem with 'Update data' option when using the 'Get parameter table by ID' data source [ID_35490]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a query using the *Get parameter table by ID* data source had the *Update data* option enabled, the component would incorrectly no longer automatically refresh the data when changes were detected.

#### Low-code apps: Sidebar would incorrectly be displayed when there was only one visible page [ID_35544]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Up to now, whether the sidebar was displayed or not would incorrectly depend on the number of pages. From now on, it will depend on the number of visible pages. In other words, the sidebar will only be displayed when there are at least two visible pages.

#### Low-code apps: Clock components in a published low-code app would incorrectly only update when you moved the mouse [ID_35554]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Clock components in a published low-code app would incorrectly only update when you moved the mouse.

#### Dashboards app: Submenu in subheader bar would incorrectly be displayed when it did not contain any visible items [ID_35570]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

The submenu in the subheader bar of a dashboard would incorrectly be displayed when it did not contain any visible items.

#### Web apps: No longer possible to clear a radio button group [ID_35603]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 [CU0] -->

It would incorrectly no longer be possible to clear a radio button group.

#### Web apps: Auto-complete control could clear its content while you were entering a value [ID_35623]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 [CU0] -->

In some cases, an auto-complete control could clear its content while you were entering a value.

#### Web apps: Problem when retrieving spectrum element parameters [ID_35660]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When the parameters of a spectrum element were retrieved in a web app, in some cases, an exception could be thrown, causing a `No parameters available` message to appear.

#### Dashboards app - Line & area chart component: Trend data could not be retrieved for spectrum parameters [ID_35676]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in a dashboard, you added a trended spectrum parameter to a line & area chart component, the component would not be able to retrieve the trend data of that parameter.

#### Dashboards app - Line & area chart component: Duplicate data in exported CSV file [ID_35688]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you exported the data shown in a line & area chart component to a CSV file, the file could incorrectly contain duplicate data.

#### Low-code apps: Feeds used in queries would incorrectly not get updated [ID_35689]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In some cases, a feed used in a query would incorrectly not get updated when the data inside the feed was updated.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Not possible to filter a GQI table by a boolean column [ID_35692]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Up to now, it would incorrectly not be possible to filter a GQI table by a boolean column.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Last nodes of a migrated query would incorrectly be cut off [ID_35693]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a GQI was migrated, in some cases, the last nodes of the migrated query would incorrectly be cut off.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - Node edge component: An incorrect tooltip would appear when hovering over a segment of an edge [ID_35696]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you hovered over a segment of an edge, in some cases, an incorrect tooltip would appear.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - Query builder: Problem when linking a data source argument of type string to a query column of type GUID [ID_35700]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When configuring an ad hoc data source in a GQI query, you can link the arguments of that ad hoc data source to a feed. However, in some cases, it would incorrectly not be possible to link an argument of type string to a query column of type GUID.

Also, in the query builder, the `Link [argument name] to feed for [argument name]` command has been renamed to `Use feed for [argument name]`.
