## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced mechanism to update the list of dashboards in the navigation pane [ID_36604]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, the list of dashboards displayed in the navigation pane on the left would be updated every 5 seconds via a polling mechanism. From now on, whenever that list is changed, all connected clients will receive an event that will update the list.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Black boxes on top of first or last field of selection boxes on small screens [ID_36738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you reduced the screen size to the point at which the navigation pane got hidden, a black box would incorrectly appear on top of the first or last field of a selection box.
