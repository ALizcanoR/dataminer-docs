## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced mechanism to update the list of dashboards in the navigation pane [ID_36604]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, the list of dashboards displayed in the navigation pane on the left would be updated every 5 seconds via a polling mechanism. From now on, whenever that list is changed, all connected clients will receive an event that will update the list.

#### Monitoring app: A new type of text area boxes will now be used on parameter pages [ID_36693]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

In the *Monitoring* app, a new type of text area boxes will now be used on parameter pages.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Version column added to 'Get trend data patterns' and 'Get trend data pattern events' data sources [ID_36754]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0  -->

The *Get trend data patterns* and *Get trend data pattern events* data sources now have a *Version* column containing the pattern version.

Each time the time range of a pattern gets updated, a new pattern record is created with a new pattern version.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Black boxes on top of first or last field of selection boxes on small screens [ID_36738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you reduced the screen size to the point at which the navigation pane got hidden, a black box would incorrectly appear on top of the first or last field of a selection box.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Table component would show skeleton loading when refetching data with external column filters applied [ID_36743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

A table component would show skeleton loading when it refetched data with external column filters applied. From now on, a table component will only show skeleton loading during the initial fetch.
