## Changes

### Enhancements

- file://

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Only one of the tables sharing an empty query would show a visual replacement [ID_36233]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

When an empty query was used by more than one table component, in some rare cases, only one of those components would display a visual replacement.

#### Low-Code Apps: A blank screen would appear when users without permission to access a low-code app tried to log on [ID_36422]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

When users without permission to access a low-code app tried to log on to that app, an error would be thrown and a blank screen would appear. From now on, when users without permission to access a low-code app try to log on to that app, an appropriate message will appear instead.
