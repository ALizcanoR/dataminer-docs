<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In the *Monitoring* app, from now on, elements, services and views opened by clicking a Visio shape will open in the same tab instead of a new tab.

#### Monitoring app - Histogram: Sidebar enhancements [ID_35797]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

In the *Monitoring* app, a number of enhancements have been made to the sidebar of the *Histogram* page of a parameter:

- The icons that allow you to switch between trend graph and histogram have been updated.
- The *Time span* selection box has been removed.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Duplicated component would not have the size as the original [ID_35804]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When you duplicated a component, the size of the duplicate would incorrectly be limited to 30 rows. From now on, when you duplicate a component, the duplicate will have the same size as the original.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Problem when feeding data from a GQI component to a query used in the same component [ID_35806]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

An error could occur when feeding data from a GQI component to a query that was used in the same component.

#### Dashboards app: A table component could appear to be empty when you rapidly switched between visualizations [ID_35831]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some cases, a table component could appear to be empty when you rapidly switched between visualizations.

Also, an error could be thrown when you tried to add an invalid query to a component.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Text boxes in the Layout tab would not update when you selected another component [ID_35851]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When, in the *Layout* tab, a text box (e.g. the box containing the title of the selected component) had the focus, and you selected another component, the text box in the *Layout* tab would incorrectly still contain the value of the previously selected component.
