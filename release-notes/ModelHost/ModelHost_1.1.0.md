## Enhancements

#### Relation request models normalized even if not all model types are hosted [ID_36733]

When you use the relation learning feature in Cube (i.e. the light bulb in a trend graph), requests are sent to Model Host to get relations.
From now on, Model Host will always balance the relation strengths when multiple kinds of relations are asked in a request, which will lead to more accurate suggestions in Cube.
