## Enhancements

#### Relation request models normalized even if not all model types are hosted [ID_36733]

When multiple kinds of relations are asked in a request to Model Host (e.g. when adding related parameters in a trend graph), from now on, Model Host will always balance the relation strengths, which can among others lead to more accurate suggestions in Cube.
