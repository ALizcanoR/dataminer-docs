- **EXPERTISE:**
Skyline offers unparalleled expertise in the various fields. This is reflected in the unique features and capabilities of our DataMiner software platform. It also means that our staff involved in the rollout of and continuous support for this solution fully understands customer's needs, both from a technology ecosystem perspective and a business perspective. Our system architects and engineers bring tremendous expertise to the table in relation to defining and implementing business processes, workflows, automation scripts, etc. Our project managers know exactly what it takes to roll out this specific type of project, what the risks are that need to be mitigated, what kind of resources are exactly required, etc. They are able to ask the right questions at the right time, and advise about the available options and the various pros and cons that come with those options.

- **FUTURE PROOF:**
A future-proof solution is extremely important for a strategic deployment, and this entails a wide range of considerations. Listed below are a couple of examples.

There are no bespoke or proprietary components in the solution that create exclusive dependencies on Skyline).
  - The platform is widely supported and endorsed by third-party system integrators and technology vendors.

- **ECONOMICS:**
The cost of the solution is a complex matter, as it also entails a lot of considerations that go way beyond the sticker price.
