# About DataMiner

## Open and fully independent software platform

DataMiner is a standard, proven and very widely adopted and endorsed, open and fully independent software platform providing

- [Data ingest & control](#data-ingest--control)
- [Data processing & workflow](#data-processing--workflow)
- [Data consumption & control surface](#data-consumption--control-surface)

### Data ingest & control

DataMiner has powerful data ingest and control plane capabilities, enabling operators to ingest data from any product, irrespective of the interface or the protocol required, transparently across any vendor or domain boundaries, covering both hardware products, software products and cloud services. With DataMiner in place, users have the unconditional guarantee that they can truly ingest any data from across their entire operation, in a secure, scalable, and fully standardized way. And because of the open architecture, anybody can design, build, and deploy new connectors for that purpose, fully supporting devops operations.  

    This part of the DataMiner System is all about creating a fully standardized and real-time updated digital twin of the entire underlying operation, which is a unique proposition and key differentiator compared to the proliferation of general-purpose data collection solutions. In that sense, DataMiner really stands for a class of its own, providing out of the box what would be otherwise a complex, cumbersome and expensive mash-up of disparate software components.

### Data processing & workflow

DataMiner features advanced out-of-the-box and fully standardized open-architecture data processing (e.g. standard advanced fault and performance management, AI-based data processing and analytics, data aggregation, industry-standard big data storage, uniform realtime service modelling and management, and much more) as well as sophisticated end-to-end workflow automation capabilities (e.g. standard orchestration, unified resource management, transparent process automation and much more). This leverages out-of-the-box integrations with the above-mentioned standard digital twin of the operation, resulting in fast, efficient and continuous deployment of solutions irrespective of new products and data sources to be connected in the future.

### Data consumption & control surface

DataMiner includes fully standardized, out-of-the-box, open-architecture data consumption and control surface tools (e.g. standard graphical bubble-up and drill-down UIs, control surfaces such as data display and button control panels, signal routing UIs, KPI dashboards, RF spectrum UIs, no-code user-definable apps, and much more) as well as powerful, standardized, professionally-secured, scalable APIs that enable plugging in any other third-party data consumption or control apps. This leverages the underlying standardized digital twin of the operation and enables fast and continuous integration of the end-to-end operation.

## Architecture

Graphically, the DataMiner architecture can be visualized as follows.

The pronounced open architecture of DataMiner enables anybody, including Skyline, end users and any third-party system integrator and ICT contractor to design powerful end-to-end solutions in a continuous fashion, enabling a devops style of operation and business. This includes connecting the DataMiner platform with new data sources and products on the fly, creating and deploying new data processing routines and logic, as well as designing and operating data consumption and control surfaces for the end users.

In that sense, the DataMiner platform can be compared to a Microsoft O365, SAP or Salesforce platform, providing a full-featured, out-of-the-box, highly integrated, standardized and proven ecosystem, where users can easily plug in their data sources and any third-party products they rely on for their operation, and focus on creating a unified, secure, scalable, and standardized open environment to consume and leverage their operational data to manage and orchestrate their services end to end, along with automation of their end-to-end technical, operational and business workflows. In addition, DataMiner also provides easy, secure and scalable access to fully standardized data for all types of consumers, both through standard included DataMiner applications or third-party data consumption products and apps.

DataMiner focuses on providing a highly standardized and fully out-of-the-box experience when it comes to data ingest, processing, flow and utilization, while providing the users complete freedom to focus their time and efforts on tailoring it and evolving it devops-style in line with their specific operational and business needs (e.g. ingesting data from their specific products, modelling their specific services, crafting their specific UIs and control surfaces, creating their unique workflows, etc.). This is essential for success, because every operation and environment is unique, and excellence can only be achieved if there is sufficient flexibility in the tooling that is leveraged.

DataMiner, for that purpose, creates a fully standardized digital twin of the operation that runs transparently across any vendor, technology or domain boundaries of an operation. The digital twin provides a realtime and fully standardized representation of all managed assets, irrespectively of hardware, software or cloud services, along with powerful standard modelling of all relationships, such as physical and logical connectivity, dependencies and much more. All standard DataMiner platform capabilities come fully integrated with those digital twin objects, enabling them to tap into the data of the digital twin objects or to control those objects out of the box, independent of the underlying technology or interfaces.

DataMiner offers the choice to be deployed as an on-premises platform, in a private or public cloud or a hybrid of the two.
