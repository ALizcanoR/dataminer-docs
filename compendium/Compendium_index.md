# DataMiner Compendium

This section provides a bird's eye view on all things DataMiner. If you are looking for more general information about DataMiner and its many features instead of practical how-to information, this is the place to be.

We are working on adding more information to this section soon, so check back for updates frequently.

At present, the following information is available:

- [About DataMiner](xref:Comp_About_DataMiner)
- [About Skyline Communications](xref:Comp_About_Skyline)
- [DataMiner Cloud Platform](xref:Comp_DCP)
