- [DataMiner Project Collaboration](#dataminer-project-collaboration)
- [DataMiner Cloud Services](#dataminer-cloud-services)
  
Accessing the DataMiner Cloud Platform only takes a couple of clicks. See also [DataMiner Cloud Services](https://skyline.be/dataminer/cloud-services).

![cloud services](~/compendium/images/CC_cloud_services.png)

The services are bundled into different tiers to which users can subscribe. Each tier contains a set of functionalities and capacities from the different services. For more information, see [DataMiner Cloud Platform Services](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-cloud-platform-services/).

## Cloud-connected DataMiner Systems

By making your DataMiner System cloud-connected, i.e. connecting it to the DataMiner Cloud Platform via a single and secured connection, it will gain a host of additional capabilities (e.g. ChatOps, Dashboard Sharing, Custom Applications and dynamic deployment of new APIs).

![secured connection](~/compendium/images/CC_secured_connection.png)

The following diagram illustrates how the DataMiner Cloud Platform acts as a pivotal central component, opening up a new world in terms of how DataMiner integrations are done, and how the interactions with partners, customers and technology vendors will take place.

- On the right side, you find various private DataMiner Systems (deployed on-premises or off-premises, or in a hybrid manner) that can be cloud-connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform, with different teams working on them.
- In the top-left corner, you find the Skyline devops team, equally connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform, which can design and deliver solutions through a sophisticated and highly automated CI/CD pipeline.
- In the bottom-left corner, you find the world that is out there. In order to build a powerful operational platform, it is very important to have strategic partnerships and the capability to easily integrate with platforms such as Azure, AWS, Teams, etc.

## DataMiner Dojo (Community)

DataMiner Dojo, which is open to everyone, brings people from the ICT media and broadband industry together to exchange knowledge and expertise, both on DataMiner specifically and on any other hot industry topics relevant to building and managing an agile, data-driven operation.

The entire Skyline community, counting well over 350 subject matter experts, uses Dojo as the primary platform to publish and share information and knowledge. As a result, knowledge and experience can flow more easily and generously than ever before between community members from across the world.

## DataMiner Project Collaboration

The DataMiner Project Collaboration module is specifically tailored towards managing design and development activities for modern ICT media and broadband solutions. It enables agile collaboration between members of a distributed DevOps team, ensuring the delivery of maximum value for your business in a continuous manner.

![collaboration 1](~/compendium/images/CC_collaboration_1.png)

As part of its solution offering, Skyline provides a full-fledged and fully integrated cloud-based collaboration ecosystem for the Project Squad, which consists of assigned Skyline staff as well as user staff, to manage the entire design and deployment process of a DataMiner Solution. This solution is referred to as DataMiner Project Collaboration.

When a DataMiner Solution is ordered, the assigned user staff will be taken through an intake process to train and prepare them for the project. As part of that they will be provided access to the Project Collaboration module in the DataMiner Cloud Platform.

![collaboration 2](~/compendium/images/CC_collaboration_2.png)

DataMiner Project Collaboration is tailored specifically towards the deployment of complex ICT media and broadband end-to-end management and orchestration solutions, and fully aligns with Agile concepts. It features all the required built-in workflows, to ensure that the joint Project Squad can efficiently collaborate in a distributed constellation and focus their energy on maximizing the value delivery for the project at hand.

## DataMiner Cloud Services

The DataMiner Cloud Services are a range of innovative services that augment your private DataMiner System, whether it is running in the cloud or on premises, by connecting it to the DataMiner Cloud Platform. These services provide integrations with online services (such as Microsoft Teams), tools to effectively collaborate with anyone inside or outside of your organization, interaction and exchange with a vibrant community of your industry peers, and much more.

Accessing the DataMiner Cloud Services only takes a couple of clicks. See also [DataMiner Cloud Services](https://skyline.be/dataminer/cloud-services).

Currently, the DataMiner Cloud Services include

- [DataMiner Catalog](#dataminer-catalog)
- [DataMiner Live Sharing Service](#dataminer-live-sharing-service)
- [Online integrations & collaboration through Microsoft Teams](#online-integrations--collaboration-through-microsoft-teams)

### DataMiner Catalog

The DataMiner Catalog is destined to become the central repository for all kinds of components to facilitate and accelerate the use of DataMiner for anybody.

While the initial version already offers access to DataMinerâ€™s vast library of interface connectors, which provide out-of-the-box integrations with over 7000 products, the catalog is also slated to support easy deployment services for dashboards, automation workflows and much more.

### DataMiner Live Sharing Service

Making the right data readily available for the right people inside and outside of your organization, that is what the new DataMiner Live Sharing Service is all about. With a click of a button, you can share any live data on your DataMiner platform, from a single metric to entire dashboards. The built-in security allows you to decide which data to share with whom and for how long.

- **Easy**: Instantly share any data in your DataMiner System with the click of a button.
- **Secure**: Share data over a single secured connection via the DataMiner cloud platform.
- **Rich set of data sources**: All your DataMiner data can be shared, from a single metric to entire service dashboards.
- **Automated**: Automatically share data with your stakeholders upon certain events in DataMiner (e.g. an incident, a new service set up for a customer, etc.).

![sharing](~/compendium/images/CC_sharing.png)

The Live Sharing Service includes multiple security gates:

- Shares can only be created by DataMiner users who are allowed to do so in your organization.
- When creating a share, you can control
    - with whom to share (list of e-mail addresses), and
    - during which period of time to share (the share will automatically be stopped).
- Sharing recipients need to authenticate with Azure AD B2C in order to access the shared data.
    - Microsoft Azure's cloud-based identity and access management service takes care of the safety of the authentication platform and automatically handling threats like DoS, password spray, or brute force attacks.
    - Users can use their preferred enterprise or social identity for authentication or create a dedicated DataMiner Cloud Platform account.
    - Compliance with a broad range of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards, including ISO 27017 and CSA-STAR (Security Trust Assurance and Risk).

For more information, see [Live Sharing Service is coming to DataMiner](https://community.dataminer.services/live-sharing-service-is-coming-to-dataminer/).

For an example of live dashboard sharing, see [DataMiner Live Dashboard Sharing](https://community.dataminer.services/use-case/dataminer-live-data-sharing/).

### Online integrations & collaboration through Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams integration offers instant notifications, instant follow-up actions, and allows you to create Teams channels on the fly.

You can control DataMiner with Microsoft Teams by giving commands such as "Show the critical alarms" or "Change output to ...". This allows remote teams to collaborate easily even if they are not in the same physical location.
