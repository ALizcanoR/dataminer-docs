The services are bundled into different tiers that users can subscribe to. Each tier contains a set of functionalities and capacities from the different services. More information about the tiers can be found at [DataMiner Cloud Platform Services - DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-cloud-platform-services/).

## Cloud-Connected DataMiner Systems

![secured connection](~/compendium/images/CC_secured_connection.png)

By making your DataMiner System (DMS) cloud-connected, i.e. connecting it to the DataMiner Cloud Platform via a single and secured connection, you will enable advantages such as sharing resources over DMS, using cloud resources, and integration with any 3rd party.

The drawing illustrates how the DataMiner Cloud Platform acts as a pivotal central component, opening up a new world in terms of how DataMiner integrations are done, and how the interactions with partners, customers and technology vendors will take place.

On the right side, you will find various private DataMiner Systems (deployed on-premises or off-premises, or hybrid), with different teams working on them, that can be cloud-connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform.

On the top left, the Skyline devops team is shown, equally connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform, enabling the team to design and deliver solutions through a sophisticated and highly automated CI/CD pipeline.

On the bottom left, you will find the world out there. In order to build a powerful operational platform, it is very important to have strategic partnerships, and easy integrations, with these platforms, such as Azure, AWS, Teams, etc.

## DataMiner Dojo (Community)

DataMiner Dojo, which is open for everybody, brings people from the ICT media and broadband industry together to exchange knowledge and expertise both on DataMiner specifically and on any other hot industry topics relevant to building and managing an agile, data-driven operation.

The entire Skyline community, counting well over 350 subject matter experts, uses Dojo as the primary platform to publish and share information and knowledge. As a result, knowledge and experience can flow more easily and generously than ever before between community members from across the world.

## DataMiner Project Collaboration

The DataMiner Project Collaboration module is specifically tailored towards the management of design and development activities for modern ICT media and broadband solutions. It enables agile collaboration between members of a distributed DevOps team, ensuring the delivery of maximum value for your business in a continuous fashion.

As part of its solution offering, Skyline provides a full-fledged and fully integrated cloud-based collaboration ecosystem for the Project Squad, which consists both of assigned Skyline staff and user staff, to manage the entire design and deployment process of a DataMiner Solution.  This solution is referred to as DataMiner Project Collaboration.

Upon order of a DataMiner Solution, the assigned user staff will be taken through an intake process to train and prepare them for the project. And as part of that they will be provided access to the Project Collaboration module in the DataMiner Cloud Platform.

DataMiner Project Collaboration is tailored specifically towards the deployment of complex ICT media and broadband end to end management and orchestration solutions, and fully aligns with Agile concepts.  It features all the required build-in workflows, to ensure that the joint Project Squad can efficiently collaborate in a distributed constellation, and focus their energy on maximizing the value delivery for the project at hand.

![sharing](~/compendium/images/CC_sharing.png)

The Live Sharing Service includes multiple security gates:

- Shares can only be created by DataMiner users approved to do so in your organization
- When creating a share, you can control exactly:
  - With whom to share (list of e-mail addresses)
  - During what period of time to share (share will automatically be stopped after this)
- Sharing recipients need to authenticate with Azure AD B2C in order to access shared data
  - Microsoft Azure’s cloud-based identity and access management service
  - Takes care of the safety of the authentication platform and automatically handling threats like DoS, password spray, or brute force attacks
  - Users can use their preferred enterprise or social identity for authentication, or can create a dedicated DataMiner Cloud Platform account
  - Compliance with broad range of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards, incl. ISO 27017 and CSA-STAR (Security Trust Assurance and Risk).

This service is introduced at [Live Sharing Service is coming to DataMiner - DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/live-sharing-service-is-coming-to-dataminer/)

An example of Live dashboard sharing is illustrated at [DataMiner Live Dashboard Sharing - DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/use-case/dataminer-live-data-sharing/)

### Online integrations / Collaboration through Teams

Enable ChatOps in DataMiner. Microsoft Teams integration offers instant notifications, instant follow-up actions, and allows you to create Teams Channels on the fly.

You can control DataMiner with Microsoft Teams by giving commands such as "Show the critical alarms" or "Change output to ...". This allows remote teams to collaborate easily even if they are not in the same physical location.
