# SRM concepts

DataMiner Service and Resource Management makes use of many dedicated DataMiner components to configure the management and orchestration of services end to end. This section provides a high-level overview of these components and explains how they can be used.

Before you [set up and configure an SRM system](xref:srm_getting_started), it is essential that you understand what these different components are and what their purpose is.

A distinction is made between "SRM definitions" and "SRM instantiations". An SRM definition determines what an object will be like. You could compare it to a class. The actual object based on the SRM definition is called an SRM instantiation. For example, a connector, which is considered an SRM definition, defines how to communicate. The element that is created based on that connector is considered an SRM instantiation.
