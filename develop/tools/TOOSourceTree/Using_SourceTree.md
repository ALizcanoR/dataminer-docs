# Using SourceTree

After starting up SourceTree, you will see a window where you can select a repository. Press the *Local* button at the top on the left-hand side to open a local repository. Here you can either specify the path to a local repository or drag and drop a Git repository folder.

When you select a Git repository, SourceTree will load the repository:

On the left-hand side, you will see an overview of the local and remote branches as well as the different tags. On the right-hand side, you will see a tree view showing the different branches, commits and tags.
