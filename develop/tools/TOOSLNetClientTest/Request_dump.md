# Request dump

With the SLNetClientTest tool, you can create a dump file for a process, i.e. a snapshot of that process at a particular time.

1. In the *Advanced* menu, select *Request dump*, and select the process for which you want to create a dump file. You can also select *(other)*, and enter the process ID (PID) for which you want to create a dump file.

2. In the *Select Dump Level* window, indicate what information should be included in the dump file, and click *OK*.

    A file with the extension .dmp will be saved in the folder *C:\\Skyline Dataminer\\logging\\CrashDump*.
