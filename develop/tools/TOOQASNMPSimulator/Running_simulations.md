# Running simulations

Once your simulation files are in the folder *C:\\QASNMPSimulations*, they will be listed in the top-left corner of the main tool in the *Available Simulation Files* box. If a simulation is not yet displayed because it has only been added to the folder recently, click the *Refresh* button below the box.

Select one or more simulation files and start the simulation(s) by clicking the *Start* button. Logging will then be displayed in the bottom section of the window.
