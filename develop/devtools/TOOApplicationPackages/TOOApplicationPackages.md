# Application packages

From DataMiner 10.0.11 onwards, it is possible to create, upload and install application packages. These application packages can be used to install a single app or a complete DataMiner Solution.

For more detailed information, see <https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/application-packages/>.

> [!NOTE]
> -  The DataMiner Application Package Builder provides a UI to create a DMAPP based on content from a DMA. See [DataMiner Application Package Builder](xref:TOODataMinerPackageBuilder#dataminer-application-package-builder).
> -  Examples of the application package scripts are available in the [Protocol Development Guide Companion Files](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/protocol-development-guide-companion-files/) and on SVN (<https://svn.skyline.be/!/#SystemDevelopmentFeature/view/head/Automation%20Scripts/>).
