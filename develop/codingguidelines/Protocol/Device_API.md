# Device API

- The implemented communication protocol in a protocol must correspond to the documented device API as defined by the vendor. An SNMP protocol is defined by a MIB file and the format must match (e.g. SNMP types). A vendor-specific protocol needs to be implemented as described in the API (e.g. a specific CRC).
