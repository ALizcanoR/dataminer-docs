# Default settings

- The port settings must contain as many default settings as possible and must be as strict as possible. This also includes disabling options that are not applicable (e.g. disabling irrelevant options: in case of a HTTP driver, we should not be able to select type of port as "Serial").

    The default bus address "bypassProxy" must be used in drivers of type HTTP.
