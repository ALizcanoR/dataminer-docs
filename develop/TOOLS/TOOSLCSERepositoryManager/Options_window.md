<br>Figure 103: SLC SE Repository Manager: Options window

Via *Tools* > *Options*, you can access a window that provides the following options:

- *Local Git Root*: Specifies the path to the local root folder.

- *SourceTree path*: Specifies the path to the SourceTree executable. This is used for the SourceTree link on the main window. By default, the SLC SE Repository Manager will look in the default installation location. If you installed SourceTree in a custom location, you will need to specify the location here.

- *Sandbox Mode*: Toggles between sandbox and normal mode.

- *DebugLog*: Link to the SLC SE Repository Manager log file.
