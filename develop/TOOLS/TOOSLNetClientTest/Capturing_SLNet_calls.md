   - This will open the "Who to follow?" window.

1. Depending on what you want to capture, select one of the following items in the *Hook Into Active Session* drop-down list:

   - For DataMiner Cube, select *Cube*.

   - For QActions, select *SLManagedScripting*.

   - For Automation scripts, select *SLManagedAutomation*.
