# NuGet Packages

NuGet is the package manager for .NET.
DIS and our CI/CD Pipeline provides tools to produce and consume NuGet Packages for use in System Development (protocols, automation scripts, custom solutions). A package is a collections of DLLs (it can also contain other items) with well-tested code that can easily be distributed, upgraded and shared. 
The NuGet Gallery (nuget.org) is the central package repository used by all package authors and consumers.
Within Skyline, we also provide an internal NuGet store: http://devcore3:81/nuget.
