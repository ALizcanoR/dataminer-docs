# NuGet naming conventions

TODO: Text about these are rules for public stuff, but would be good practice to do it for internal NuGets as well. Less work in the future when needing to go public.

## Mandatory rules

- NuGet must have a name that starts with 'Skyline.DataMiner'.
- NuGet must include a license file when published to nuget.org
- NuGet must be signed otherwise this will be blocked by nuget.org 
- [Mandatory metadata](#mandatory-metadata)

<br/>

- If there is a dependency on a DataMiner DLL (from the Skyline DataMiner/Files folder), use the corresponding NuGet (Skyline.DataMiner.Files.XXX).
    - If it is not there, contact the [Data-Acquisition](mailto:support.data-acquisition@skyline.be) domain. They can then include this DLL in the automatic NuGet creation from DataMiner versions.
- If there is a dependency on multiple DataMiner DLLs that are default included in a QAction/Exe, then make use of the DevPacks (Skyline.DataMiner.Dev.XXX)

<br/>

- Use the syntax: 'Skyline.DataMiner.\[Categories\].\[Name\]'. Optionally at the end you could have '.Protocol', '.Automation', '.Common', ... to specify on where it can be used (usage of SLManagedScripting, SLManagedAutomation, ...)
    - Skyline.DataMiner.\[Categories\].\[Name\].Common (Shared code that can run either in Script or Protocol. Communicates with DataMiner via SLNet or [DataMinerSystem](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Skyline.DataMiner.Core.DataMinerSystem))
    - Skyline.DataMiner.\[Categories\].\[Name\].Automation (Acts as entrypoint for Automation (methods for IEngine) or has a dependency on classes from SLManagedAutomation)
    - Skyline.DataMiner.\[Categories\].\[Name\].Protocol (Acts as entrypoint for Protocol (methods for SLProtocol) or has a dependency on classes from SLManagedScripting)

    - Another situation is the module that it has to do with. An example of this is the CI/CD packages:
        - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.DMApp.Common (common code for creating a package)
        - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.DMApp.Automation (specific code to convert an Automation solution to dmapp package)
        - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.DMApp.XXX (specific code to convert a XXX solution/repository to dmapp package)

## Mandatory metadata

TODO: Add picture
-	Authors is without whitespace
-	License will be provided later (Currently checking with Legal) (NuGets created via SLC SE Repo Manager will have the icon & license added automatically)
-	Icon can be checked with Marketing (We'll check if there can be a generic icon to start with)
-	Tags: Always include Skyline & DataMiner at the minimum.

> NuGets (SDK style projects) made via the SLC SE Repo Manager will have some meta data (license, default icon, ...) automatically added or overwritten.


## Restricted names

- Skyline.DataMiner.Files.XXX (DataMiner DLLs - Autogenerated by tool from Data-Acquisition domain)
- Skyline.DataMiner.Dev.XXX (DevPacks - Autogenerated by tool from Data-Acquisition domain)
- Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.XXX (Managed by Data-Acquisition domain)

## Names to be used

- Skyline.DataMiner.Core.XXX
    - Holds the items that have a direct link to DataMiner (AppPackage creation/installation, DataMinerSystem, ...)
    - DxM will also fall under this. Take in account the have clear error handling in case the DxM is optional and not available.
- Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.XXX
    - Holds all the utilities like helpers, parsers, ...
        - E.g.: SNMP trap parsing, rate calculations, table context menu, ...
