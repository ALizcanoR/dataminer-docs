# Properties

- PascalCasing must be used for property names.

- A property should be named using a noun, noun phrase or adjective.

- Collection properties should be named with a plural phrase instead of a singular phrase followed by the collection type (e.g. "TransportStreams" instead of "TransportStreamList").

- Boolean properties should start with a prefix "Is", "Has", "Can", "Supports", "Allows".
