# Page button dimensions

- The width of a page button must be explicitly defined in the protocol. A minimum width of 110 is advised. Only use a larger value when necessary. However, keep the width of page buttons as uniform as possible (e.g. in case there are two page buttons and for one page button a width of 120 is required, it is better to also set the width of the other page button to 120).
