# Title case

- When title case should be used (e.g. parameter descriptions), every word has to start with a capital letter, except words with three letters or less, unless they are:

    - the first word of the description, or

    - a reserved word like a unit of measure that requires specific capitalization, or

    - a noun, a pronoun or a verb.
