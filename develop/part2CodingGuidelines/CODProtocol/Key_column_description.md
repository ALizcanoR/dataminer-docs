# Key column description

- The column containing the unique user-friendly label that is used to allow users to identify a row (i.e. the display key in case the primary key is not user-friendly) must have "\[IDX\]" included in the description. In case the table name is added between parentheses for additional context, "\[IDX\]" should be positioned before the table name, e.g. "Name \[IDX\] (Devices)".
