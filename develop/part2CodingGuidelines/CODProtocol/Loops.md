# Loops

- The amount of code inside a loop should be kept as small as possible. Code that is not needed in a loop should be moved out of the loop.

- Avoid calling properties inside a loop.

- Break out of the loop as soon as possible (using the break keyword).

- Go to the next iteration as soon as possible (using the continue keyword).
