# Operation execution delay

- Make sure that there are no large delays between operations. E.g. a button set should be executed right away. Because of this, the content of a group must be limited to a maximum of 10 pairs or SNMP parameters. In case SNMP tables are used in groups, each table should be included in a different group containing only this table.
