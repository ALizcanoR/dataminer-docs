# Column descriptions

- In case a table has a column that has the same description as a column defined in another table, add the table description (or an abbreviation of the table description) at the end of the column description, in parentheses. For example, for tables with the names "Services" and "Streams", the following column descriptions can be used: "State (Services)" and "State (Streams)".
