# Serial single

When creating a serial connection towards a device, DataMiner combines all the connections (when there are multiple connections for the same device). This might not be desired behavior since a device sometimes allows multiple clients to be connected on the device. In this case, this behavior can be disabled by setting the protocol type to “serial single”.
