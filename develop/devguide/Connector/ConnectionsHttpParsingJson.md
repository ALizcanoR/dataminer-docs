# Parsing JSON

In order to process JSON-formatted data, the Json.NET framework can be used. This library is included in DataMiner.

For extensive documentation and examples illustrating how to use this framework, refer to https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Introduction.htm

> [!NOTE]
> Since DataMiner 9.5.9, version 10.0.2 of the Newtonsoft.Json DLL is included in the ProtocolScripts folder. DataMiner versions prior to 9.5.9 will use the Newtonsoft.Json DLL from the files folder instead. Therefore, when developing for a version prior to DataMiner 9.5.9, ensure that the used functionality from this DLL is included in all versions that need to be supported.
