# Normal WebSocket Connection

The normal WebSocket connection is used when the connection url/ip address is filled in at the creation of the element. No configuration is needed in the element after startup. It is not possible with this use case to reconnect the connection after a disconnect.

> [!NOTE]
> This use case should not be used!!
>
> After a disconnection of the WebSocket, the element needs a restart.
